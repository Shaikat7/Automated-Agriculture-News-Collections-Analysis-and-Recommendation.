Low wind speed, lowering of atmospheric temperature, high rain and low sea surface temperature are cited as probable environmental cues

It is nearly August, and it is, perhaps, time for heavy rain and blooms along the beaches in Chennai.

Adequate nutrients brought by substantial rain and a high abundance of the plankton, called diatom Thalassiosira sp. triggered the (bioluminescent) bloom of Noctiluca scintillans, says a study done by the National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR).

The plankton is available in the ocean and due to nutrition available, it will multiply and becomes the bloom. Low wind speed, lowering of atmospheric temperature, high rain and low sea surface temperature are cited as probable environmental cues, the report said.

Local hydrodynamics and the diverging currents governed the presence and dispersion of the sudden outbreak of the bioluminescent dinoflagellate Noctiluca scintillans bloom in the region.

The paper, which was written by Pravakar Mishra, Mehmuda Begum, Anitha Gera and others and published recently in the scietific journal Oceanologia, focused on the occurrence of bloom along a 16-km stretch following a spell of heavy rain in August 2019.

During the period, when the team took physical samples from the beaches, including Marina, Elliots, Panaiyurkuppam and Kovalam, the wind speed was low at 5 m/sec, temperature fell, high rainfall was recorded one day, and sea surface temperature was low.

The density of Noctiluca scintillans varied from 1,000 cells/litre to 19,000 cells/litre, with a distinguished distribution pattern. An abundance of scintillans was recorded at Panaiyurkuppam and Kovalam with 19,000 cells/litre and 18,000 cells/litre respectively.

The paper explained that once the bloom reduces, there is an increase in bacterial population associated with the phyto-plankton bloom. The lowest count was recorded on the Panaiyurkuppam beach and the maximum on Elliot’s Beach. Total coliform too was recorded in the waves.

Bioluminescence was observed owing to turbulence and intense wave breaking in the surf zone, stimulating bioluminescence in Noctiluca scintillans cells. Within two days after the appearance of bioluminescence, the blooming cells slowly degenerated and moved away by the current, and finally declined.",1
796240,Residents of VGN colony in Sekkadu brace themselves for floods,"They also complain of sewage contaminating groundwater

They also complain of sewage contaminating groundwater

Midway through last year, the Avadi Corporation completed the construction of a concrete drain to carry surplus water from Vilinjiyambakkam lake to Cooum river in Sekkadu. The facility had been constructed after a series of representations by residents of VGN Springfield Phase One, off Sekkadu Main Road, Kamaraj Nagar in Avadi. However, residents point out the drain is not going to make any difference and this monsoon too they expect flooding of their locality.

Residents find the new drain narrow considering the huge overflow of water expected from the lake.

Crofton Garden & Springfield Kosmos Owners Welfare Association has taken up this issue with the Avadi Corporation.

“The drain is not wide enough. Further, the drain meanders through a landscape marked by encroachments. Hence, the drain will be rendered ineffective,” says J Stephen Raj, the Association’s treasurer.

Residents note that the entire colony comes under sheets of water during the rainy season.

“There are instances of water entering houses and people having to leave their houses temporarily. Vehicles had been damaged. Restoring normality had entailed additional expenditure. Snakes, scorpions, crabs and fish can be spotted in the flooded water. To avoid any untoward incident, power would be suspended. However, there have been a few instances of cows getting electrocuted,” says Stephen.

With the onset of north-east monsoon a few months away, the Association wants the Avadi Corporation to have a stop-gap arrangement in place.

“In the oncoming north-east monsoon, even with light to moderate rainfall, VGN colony is likely to suffer severe flooding. Because the waterbodies around the colony have been interconnected. Provisions have been made for surplus water from Sekkadu lake, Thiruninravur lake, Palavedu lake, Pattabiram lake, Kavarapalayam lake to flow into Vilinjiyambakkam lake and this in turn will overflow into our residential colony and cause flooding. An official from Avadi Corporation cautioned us about this possibility last week,” adds Stephen.

Another issue plaguing VGN Springfield Phase One neighbourhood is sewage overflow.

“Residents of other areas in Sekkadu let out sewage into the stormwater drains in VGN colony, which results in contamination of the groundwater. The borewells of two under-construction houses in VGN colony bear proof of water contamination. There is an underground drainage network in those areas and there is also a sewage pumping station. However, for reasons unknown to us, the drainage network is not in operation,” says M. Rajaram, another resident of the VGN neighbourhood.

VGN Colony is also reportedly plagued by poor illumination

“Nearly 700 families reside in this layout, but the Corporation has not provided street-lights. The existing lights were provided by the property developer and none of them is functioning now. With the streets poorly-lit, theft of motorcycles, bicycles and construction materials happens. It is quite unsafe during rainy season when the streets are waterlogged. Also, Sekkadu Main Road, the approach road to VGN Colony is poorly-lit. Most of the days, the main road is plunged in darkness, as the street-lights do not burn. There have been accidents, the latest occurring on July 19 around 8 p.m. when a motorcyclist was hit by a car and was rushed to the hospital,” says P. Ajoy Kumar, another resident of VGN colony.

796484,"Andhra farmers turn masons, milkmen despite state getting ‘decent’ rain; here is why","They blame lack of remuneration, rising input costs and accumulating debt

Andhra Pradesh has received around 20 per cent more rainfall than is normal for this time of the year, according to the state weather department. The state’s reservoirs have enough water now. However, kharif crop coverage in the state is down, according to government data. Worse, farmers are refusing to cultivate and are considering other vocations.

The weekly kharif crop coverage report released by the Commissionerate of Agriculture showed that crops like paddy, sorghum, fox-tailed millet, red gram, green gram, black gram and chilli peppers are down 25 per cent.

The acreage for pearl millet, maize, groundnut, castor, onion, turmeric and sugarcane is between 26 per cent and 50 per cent. Acreage under cotton is 51 per cent and 75 per cent and sunflower 76 per cent and 100 per cent.

Farmers across the state told this reporter that the lack of remunerative prices, rising input costs as well as accumulating debt was making them disenchanted with agriculture.

A prominent agricultural expert noted that farmers had been suffering ever since united Andhra Pradesh was bifurcated in the last decade. The main reason, he said, was faulty government policies.

Vocational changes

R Mallikarjuna Reddy from Gopulapuram revenue village in the Duvvuru mandal (headed by a tehsildar) of YSR Kadapa district, has left farming, having lost hope.

“I sold 1.21 hectares of my land to pay debts over the last three years and have Rs five lakhs in debt still. I am not willing to take up paddy cultivation again even on a tenancy basis and have become a mason now in the near-by Proddatur town,” he told this reporter.

Gopulapuram is irrigated by the KC canal and gets assured water for one crop from the Srisailam dam around August.

Mallikarjuna’s fellow villager M Pratap Reddy incurred a Rs 60 lakh debt in farming. He said, “The endowment land of seven acres I used to cultivate for Rs 1 lakh tenancy has now been taken for Rs 46,000 per year. I now hear tenant farmers asking for investment from land owners to take up farming.”

C Varadarajulu Reddy, another farmer who sold 0.6 hectacres of his land and used to cultivate 16.2 hectares of leased land, has pinned hope on dairy farming.

He said he might take up cultivation only on his left-over land of 2.42 hectares to get fodder for dairy cattle.

Tenancy in AP is the highest in the country and is pegged at 42.4 per cent according the 77th Round Survey of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), 2019. Sustaining viability of farming for tenant farmers against this backdrop attains added significance in the state.

Other farmers have not changed vocations. But, they have changed crops.

S Fakruddin, a farmer from Kadivella village of Yemmiganur mandal in Kurnool district has taken up cotton cultivation, given the minimum guarantee it gives over other crops.

B Suresh Babu, a farmer from Kanumuru village, in Pamarru mandal of Krishna district, who claimed he had cultivated 28-32 hectares (Eight hectares of his own and the rest leased land) for the last 40 years, had now restricted himself to his own land.

“The cost of labour has shot up from a third of the input cost to 50 per cent now. But the labour is also not happy as prices of all commodities have risen.

“Recently, we had tenant farmers from the adjacent NTR district, who cultivated chillies, come as labourers to pay the lease amount to land owners. Major chilli-growing areas had lost the crop to thrips, an invasive species of pest,” he added.

Investment for even vegetable crops like cucumber, ridge gourd and bottle gourd has become more now as they too have been hit by diseases, the farmer added.

The farmers are not mulling a crop holiday like their counterparts in the Konaseema district.

M Satyanarayana, a farmer from Pedamuttevi village of Mouvva mandal in Krishna district owns 0.8 hectares and has taken 3.23 hectares on tenancy, said:

There is no crop holiday here. While the governments gloat over giving us Rs 13,500 for a year I lost nearly Rs one lakh as I received only Rs 1,250 per 75 kg paddy bag while the minimum support price is Rs 1,550.

Seed and fertiliser dealers in the Sodam mandal of Chittoor district rue the lack of sales. When the price of tomatoes increased to Rs 70 a kg in March and April this year, the government intervened to provide relief to consumers.

It is turning a blind eye when tomatoes sell at Rs 7 per kg, they say. In such a situation, how will farmers take up cultivation, they ask.

GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture based in Hyderabad blamed the situation on the policies adopted by successive state governments.

“This is courtesy falling investment of governments in agriculture to improve productivity. This is happening since the division of the state.

“Successive governments have not made much difference in improving overall agriculture. This calls for a significant shift in the agricultural policy support to the farmers,” he added.

Normal Monsoon

The state weather department has characterised the southwest monsoon in AP as ‘normal’.

The monsoon, which had to enter AP June 1, set in June 13, 2022 and advanced over some parts of coastal AP June 15. It covered the entire state by June 20.

AP has received 238.3 millimetres (mm) of rain, compared to a normal of 199.3 mm for this time of the year.

Of the 26 districts in the state, East Godavari and West Godavari metrological sub divisions received an excess rain of 62 and 52 per cent respectively.

Stella, the director of the India Metrological Department of AP, told this reporter that a departure of minus 19 to plus 19 per cent from normal rainfall was usually considered normal.

“The damage to crops cannot be deduced depending on just the rains. Additional factors like flood water from upper riparian states could also affect.

“Low-lying areas could be affected more. So, the minus 14 per cent rain in Vishakhapatnam and minus four percent rain in Kurnool are considered normal,” she said.

Water levels in major reservoirs of the state were 568.12 billion cubic feet (tmc) as on July 20, 2022. They had stood at 413.22 tmc last year on the corresponding date.",0
796692,"Erratic pre-monsoon, monsoon rainfall impacts North East agriculture","Kharif cultivation of paddy delayed in Assam, Tripura, Nagaland; Boro harvest was affected too

Farms in Assam were destroyed by the incessant monsoon rains this year. Photo: Wikimedia Commons

Unusual rainfall trends in the pre-monsoon and monsoon showers this year have affected agriculture in the North East. Mixed agricultural practices in many areas have, however, helped balance crop yield despite the erratic rains from March through July.

Farms in Assam were destroyed by the incessant monsoon rains that submerged large parts of the state earlier this month. The state faced prolonged and devastating floods in the critical period of agriculture activities, even though heavy pre-monsoon showers had helped prepare fields for Kharif paddy cultivation.

Usually, the North East receives about 20-25 per cent of its annual rainfall in the pre-monsoon period. But this year, it was 62 per cent above average — the highest in the last 10 years, according to India Meteorological Department.

However, the southward migration of monsoon trough in monsoon 2022 caused deficient rainfall across 90 per cent of districts of the North East states.

Summer crops have been completely damaged in Assam, said Rajib Lochan Deka of the department of agricultural meteorology, Assam Agricultural University, Jorhat.

Heavy rain in May and June had affected the Boro harvest as well. The flooding has delayed the Kharif cultivation of paddy and rice yield is expected to be significantly affected this year.

Most rice nurseries were damaged due to floods, causing an inevitable shortage of rice seedlings for normal transplanting in Tripura and Assam. Assam’s agriculture department has set up community nurseries where submergence tolerant rice varieties like Ranjit sub-1, Bahadur sub-1, Swarna sub-1, Jalashri and Jalkuwari were sown, said Deka.

“Anticipating a flood or drought-like situation in August, we have recommended short-duration rice varieties like Luit and Disang, which can be transplanted till the first week of September without any risk to the yield,” he said.

Arunachal Pradesh saw a deficit of 68 per cent in the pre-monsoon rainfall. This had a mixed impact on the farming system, said Kaushik Bhagawati, a technical officer of Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in Basar.

Bhagawati pointed out that low rainfall delayed the sowing of summer vegetables, but it favoured the clearing of forest and land preparation for Jhum cultivation in Arunachal.

The state had received an exceptionally high amount of rain in April, 127 per cent above average. This had a very adverse impact on agriculture, especially on newly sown summer crops.

Crops of okra, bottle gourd, cucumber, chilli peppers and tomato, which are economically very important for Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura farmers, were badly damaged.

June saw abnormally high rainfall, 64 per cent above average. This was detrimental mainly for paddy cultivation in the region as it submerged the wet-land rice fields and nurseries.

The standing paddy crops in Jhum cultivation were reportedly damaged by surface run-off. Maize production was also damaged by high rainfall in May and June.

Pre-monsoon rainfall in Tripura was 11 per cent above normal. It affected the yield of vegetables but favoured the raising of paddy seedlings, said Dhiman Daschoudhuri, technical officer of Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa (GKMS) of ICAR Tripura.

GKMS is an IMD initiative to give modern and scientific knowledge of weather and climate to farmers.

However, the monsoon rain has been in deficit. “Transplanting the seedlings is a problem as fields have turned dry. But the scanty rain will help harvest a good yield of vegetables,” Daschoudhuri said.

Earlier, the farmers in the country’s North East depended on traditional knowledge to understand the weather patterns. But the rainfall patterns are shifting now. GKMS has helped make this knowledge modern and scientific.

Now, at least 10 lakh farmers of the region are directly linked with the system and get real-time weather alerts on both a long and short-term basis. This helps them minimise the losses in the farm produce.

Rainfall in Meghalaya, almost double the April-June average, helped in crop production on the hilly slopes. However, Debasish Chakraborty, agriculture scientist of ICAR Baramani said, “Heavy rainfall is having adverse impact on agriculture.”

The rainfall went 70 per cent into deficit in July, which will have a significant impact on rice production this year.

Abnormal temperature variation was also noticed across Meghalaya, which might also affect yield.

Nagaland’s shifting rainfall trends have Imtisenla Walling, the technical officer for GKMS Nagaland, concerned.

Deficit rainfall in monsoon has delayed the sowing of Kharif paddy, she said. A similar situation happened in March when rainfall was 90 per cent below normal and affected summer agriculture.

Manipur and Mizoram also recorded deficit rainfall between March and June, but in July, the rain in Mizoram was close to average, said Samik Choudhuri, technical officer for GKMS in Mizoram.",1
796699,March-April heatwave impacted agriculture in 9 Indian states: ICAR report,"Heatwaves resulted in poor vegetative and retarded growth, pest infestation like fall army and whitefly attacks and viral infections in crops and livestock

A new report by Indian Council of Agricultural Research has shed light on the extent and kind of crop damage that happened due to the scorching heatwave in the months of March and April 2022.

The heatwave had impcted wheat yield and subsequently, a shortage of grain. But it also resulted in poor vegetative and retarded growth, pest infestation like fall army and whitefly attacks and viral infections in crops and livestock, the report titled Heat Wave 2022: Causes, Impacts, and Way Forward for Indian Agriculture stated.

The abnormal increase in maximum and minimum temperatures during 2022 impacted crops, fruits, vegetables and animals in the nine states of Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra.

Poor pod setting, wilting and forced maturity, flower drop and poor pollination were observed in rabi crops like green gram, maize, chickpea, cowpea and mustard.

They were also seen in important horticulture crops like mango, citrus, apples, plum, pomegranate, lemon, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, bitter gourd, tomato and okra, the report stated.

The hot weather also increased the body temperature of livestock and milch animals by 0.5 to 3.5 degrees Celsius (°C), which reduced milk yields by 15 per cent. Diary animals faced the problem of increased calf mortality and skin infection.

Rise in temperatures also reduced egg production by up to 10 per cent during the initial two days of the heatwave. Subsequently, the drop was maintained at about 4-7 per cent, based on the ambient temperature.

In India, the months of March and April in 2022 witnessed an unusual increase in maximum and minimum temperatures, with departure from the mean exceeding by more than 5°C at some places.

The temperature was appreciably above normal in most parts of the country. Northwest and central India experienced their hottest April in 122 years, with average maximum temperatures reaching 35.9°C and 37.8°C, respectively.

“During this period, the extreme temperatures were found to be higher by 8°C to 10.8°C and the rainfall lower by 60 to 99 per cent, compared to normal in 10 out of 36 meteorological subdivisions,” said the report.

As a result, a reduction of vegetable yields up to 40 to 50 per cent compared to normal was observed in a few areas, especially in Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.

Further, there was a 20 per cent yield reduction in green gram and 18 per cent in maize due to fall army worm attack.

Horticulture and wheat

A reduction of 23 per cent was observed in kinnow yield in Punjab. Chickpea in Haryana also experienced a yield reduction up to 19 per cent. In Uttar Pradesh, a temperature increase of 5°C in March from the normal resulted in flower drop and lots of jhumka (a fruiting disorder) in mango trees.

In Himachal Pradesh, viral infection and petal fall in both royal and spur-type apples were observed. Similarly, malformation, flower and fruit drop in mango were observed in Himachal Pradesh’s Chamba, Kullu and Bilaspur districts.

Mango orchards in several districts of Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar were affected. Drying of leaves and plants in guava, lemon and mango; flower and fruit drop in papaya were observed over Bhilwara and Sirohi districts of Rajasthan.

Flower and fruit drop in pomegranate and lemon was observed in Pali district of Rajasthan.

The report says that the heatwave coincided with wheat’s grain filling and development stage and resulted in average reduction of yields up to 15-25 per cent.

But in some areas like Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh, the yield loss was as high as 32 to 34 per cent. Even the 75 per cent timely sown wheat crop (planted on or before November 15) was affected by the sudden rise in temperature.

“In India, wheat was sown in an area of about 31 million hectares (ha) during the 2021-22 cropping season. Out of this, approximately 75 per cent was timely sown.

The timely sown crop was in excellent condition under north west plain zone (Haryana, Punjab, West UP) and north east plain zone (east UP, Bihar and West Bengal) till second week of March,” according to the report.

But the sudden rise in temperature affected the crop. The late sown crop (in about 6-7 million ha area) got affected severely, the report added.

The report said: “The year 2022 will be remembered as a classic example of coupled impact of high temperature and subdued rainfall on agricultural production systems, specifically in northern and central India.”",1
796703,March-April heatwave impacted agriculture in 9 Indian states: ICAR report,"Some 360 pigs culled last weekend after detection of disease on two farms in Wayanad

The Kerala government has stepped in to help pig farmers in the state in the wake of an outbreak of African swine fever in Wayanad district. It has started efforts to purchase all medically stable pigs in the state at the prevailing market rate, to slaughter and pack them for export.

It has done this after complaints by farmers and slaughterhouses that they had suffered losses due to adverse campaigns in the face of the detection of cases in Wayanad.

Read Down To Earth’s coverage of African swine fever

Koothattukulam-based state-owned Meat Products of India will procure the pigs and facilitate the export of scientifically processed meat. It will first purchase all pigs in Wayanad and procure animals from other districts later.

Kerala currently has a stock of 100,000 pigs, according to state veterinary minister J Chinchurani. Wayanad, the ground zero for the current outbreak, is the hub of pig rearing in Kerala and has 244 farms. These farms house 6,454 matured pigs and 4,740 minors.

An owner will get a compensation of Rs 15,000 if matured pigs are culled after detection of African swine fever. For the minors, the maximum compensation will be Rs 5,800.

The government hopes its plan would be a significant relief for farmers.

The outbreak of African swine fever in Wayanad district is likely to devastate pig populations and the farmers who rear them, according to veterinary experts. But it would not affect human health.

“It does not affect human health. But it will devastate pig populations and the farming economy,” veterinary expert Arun Zachariah told this reporter.

What actually happened?

The Kerala government decided to go in for mass culling of pigs July 22, 2022, after African swine fever cases were reported among 360 pigs in two breeding farms at Thavinjal village in the Mananthavady taluk of Wayanad district.

The culling of the affected pigs was completed late on the night of July 24, under the supervision of a dozen experts from Bengaluru.

Senior veterinary surgeon S Dayal who supervised the culling operations, said the carcases were buried in five massive pits about 80 metres away from the respective farms.

Culling will be initiated next week on three other farms in Wayanad, where the viral disease has been confirmed. The district administration has declared a one-km radius infection zone in all these places and restricted entry there.

Wayanad district collector A Geetha told this reporter that investigations were on to trace how the disease reached the two pig farms in Mananthavady taluk.

Health authorities suspect people from North East India, Bihar, and West Bengal, who work as labourers in Wayanad’s pig farms, might have turned carriers of the virus.

Many who work in the farms have visited Assam, Bihar, West Bengal and Nagaland in the last two months. These states are reporting large-scale African swine fever cases.

The virus might have reached Kerala through the dress and footwear of the farm workers, officials suspect.

“The virus is highly resistant in the natural environment, meaning it would survive on clothing, footwear, vehicle parts and other materials. The fever can also survive in pork products, such as ham, sausages, or bacon,” Zachariah said.

He said precautionary measures such as intensive cleaning, disinfection and sanitisation work should be undertaken on farms that have reported the cases.

“We have taken all precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the disease,” Geetha said. She added that all farm owners have been advised to ensure minimum human contact with pigs.

“The advisory has been issued as a precautionary measure and there is a minimal chance that humans are affected by the African swine fever,” she added. She also said cooked pig meat was safe for consumption.

Kerala has also banned the transportation of pigs and pig meat from outside the state.

The Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University has started a massive awareness campaign to educate pig farmers on the disease. It has also taken steps to enhance bio-safety measures at the University pig farms at Mannuthy in Thrissur and Pookode in Wayanad.",1
796709,Monsoon 2022: Erratic rains may delay Odisha Kharif crops,"Dry June led to late paddy transplantation; More than half of targetted acreage lie uncultivated

Levelling of land by farmers happening in July, much later than usual. Photo: Hrusikesh Mohanty

A dry June followed by a rainy July might delay Kharif crops in Odisha this monsoon. Farmers in several districts, mainly the western and coastal areas, have yet to start paddy transplantation due to erratic rainfall.

Through July 23, paddy was sown in 1.27 million hectares out of 3.5 million hectares planned by the Odisha government’s agriculture department for the current kharif season. This is less than half of the target, around 40 per cent.

Paddy cultivation was completed in 1.53 million hectares in the same period last year, according to a Crop Weather Watch Group report. The Union Ministry of Agriculture has set up the watch group that focusses on curative and preventive measures.

Monsoon 2022 hit Odisha on June 16, but several areas did not see rain until June 28. June saw a deficit rainfall of 37 per cent said HR Biswas, director for Bhubaneswar centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The deficiency was, however, compensated within 10 days in July. The state received 201.5 mm of rainfall from July 9-18.

The erratic rain patterns have farmers worried. Kharif farming usually begins in May-end with land-levelling, while seedlings are raised in June following monsoon rains.

The transplantation usually happens in July, said Sameer Pradhan, a farmer in Ganjam district’s Sheragada block.

“Farmers raised the nurseries in July this year due to lack of rain. The transplantation is yet to begin,” Pradhan said.

Another farmer in Chandabali in Bhadrak district has the same story. “The late transplantation of paddy might lead to losses,” feared Kishore Das.

The state saw an average rainfall of 131.3 millimetres in June, against an average of 209.3 mm. The influence of two low pressures in the Bay of Bengal on July 4 and 9 led to the rain in July, said Uma Shankar Das, a senior IMD scientist.

From June 1 through July 24, 2022, Odisha received 477.7 mm of rainfall, against an average of 466.7 mm, said IMD, Bhubaneswar regional centre.

Four districts received excess rainfall in the same period, two districts were in deficit and the rest (24 districts) were in the normal category. Districts like Boudh, Malkangiri, Kandhamal and Dhenkanal recorded excess rain by 20-50 per cent than their average.

West Odisha districts like Sundargarh and Sambalpur registered a deficit of 38 per cent and 23 per cent through July 23, respectively.

Farmers in Koraput, a southern Odisha district, said they were satisfied with the rain this year.

“The transplanting in this area is in full swing, as the rain is almost normal,” said an agriculture officer. Around 70 per cent of the total paddy area of 86,000 hectares has been cultivated in Koraput, he said.

Cultivation of Kala Jeera, a local variety of an aromatic short grain crop cultivated by a few farmers in the district, has also not been affected.

“The variety was cultivated in around 3,000 hectares in Koraput,” said Mihir Ranjan Mohanty, the officer in-charge of the regional research and technology transfer substation.

The substation is a research unit of Odisha University of Agriculture & Technology (OUAT), an agricultural university.

Agriculture experts, however, said it was too early to predict the situation. “Kharif activities will extend to the end of August,” said Amaresh Khuntia, professor of Agronomy, OUAT.

There was hope that the situation would improve in the next month, Khuntia said.

The professor has advised farmers to cultivate the short and medium-duration varieties if there is no rainfall in the next week to 10 days.

In the Kharif season, the irrigation projects only supply around 50 per cent of water needed for cultivation. The other half depends on the rain, said JP Rath, a retired engineer-in-chief of the water resources department, Odisha.

The department has planned to provide irrigation facilities to around 2.7 million hectares of crops this monsoon.

Depending on the water level of the reservoirs and the monsoon rainfall trend, sources like deep bore-wells and check dams will be used for irrigation.

The state has around 63 reservoirs, including 10 major ones, which can irrigate up to 4.3 million hectares, sources said.",1
796710,Madhya Pradesh farmers were craving rain; now they fear too much of it,"Rainfall status yo-yos from 23% deficit to 20% excess in a month

Farmers in Madhya Pradesh, who had been craving rain, are now afraid of too much of it. Their crops of maize and soyabean have either been destroyed or have turned yellow due to the rains.

Flat fields have turned slushy. Crop seedlings have been destroyed due to soil erosion in the state’s hilly areas. Bunds meant for paddy cultivation have been broken and washed away.

Read Scanty June rain forces MP farmers to sow paddy a second time

This is the situation in half of the state’s districts including Narmadapuram, Harda, Dhar, Chhindwara, Betul, Bhopal, Sehore and Vidisha.

The state had received 23 per cent less rainfall than normal till June 28, 2022. But then, drought turned to deluge, with the state receiving 388.5 millimetres (mm) by July 20.

Madhya Pradesh usually receives 323.2 mm by this date. This means it has received 20 per cent more rain than normal.

It has been raining all over the state. In some places, up to 100 per cent more rainfall than normal has been recorded.

For example, Betul district was supposed to receive 359.7 mm of rain till July 20. But it has received 720 mm of rainfall, which is 100 per cent more than normal. The crops in such districts have been severely affected.

Destroyed crops

Madhya Pradesh had aimed to sow kharif crops on 0.15 million hectares this year. So far, only 68 per cent of the area has been sown. This is primarily due to the abnormal monsoon so far.

The maize crop, which was supposed to grow to a height of three to three-and-a-half feet till July 20, is stuck at one-and-a-half to two feet. The crop has been destroyed in fields located in areas that are flat and have black soil.

Farmers were relying on maize as it ripens well at low input cost. Also, its price has been Rs 2,200-2,500 per quintal for the last few years. But now, farmers are worried that if the rains do not stop, the sown seeds will not ripen.

Nitin Yadav, a farmer from Devthan village in Betul, had planted maize on 0.6 hectares in his field. But waterlogging has ruined it.

“The soyabean crop is also not growing. Now, the crop will not ripen even if the sun blooms. The field will have to be kept empty till rabi sowing. It is a very unusual situation,” he said.

The soyabean crop also cannot tolerate heavy rain, like maize. It starts to turn yellow, the roots begin to rot and the leaves start to fall. All this has already begun to happen.

Soyabean had been sown in 90 per cent of the area of about 175 villages in the Seoni Malwa tehsil of Narmadapuram. These villages have been receiving continuous rain for the last 10 days, due to which the crop has not able to grow.

Surajbali Jat, a farmer from Chapragrahan village in the tehsil and a provincial member of the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (Central India), said soyabean needed sunshine, which was not available.

“By now, its height should have increased from one-and-a-half to two feet. But it is only seven to eight inches currently. A slight yellowness has also started to appear. If the rain does not stop, the crop will be completely affected,” he said.

Suresh Patidar, a farmer from Nisarpur in Kukshi tehsil of Dhar district, had planted cotton on 3.64 hectares two months ago.

“The cotton crop needs breaks of sunlight in between spells of rains. But it has been raining for 10 days due to which the growth has stopped,” Patidar said.

He added that if the weather was good, on an average, 10-12 quintals per acre are produced. “But whether I get a good harvest this time is not certain. Earlier, even if the rains started late, there were always breaks of sunlight,” he said.

Weather experts consider this change in rainfall conditions in such a short period of time to be serious.

“We can only tell the farmer not to allow water to accumulate in the fields and if it is happening, arrange for its drainage. If there is weed in the fields, clean it,” Vijay Kumar Srivastava, an agricultural scientist at the District Krishi Vigyan Kendra, Betul, said.

He added that such measures could save the crops for now. If any kind of pest was infesting the crop, farmers could prevent try to prevent the infestation by consulting scientists.",1
796711,"Rains fall short: Major losses ahead, fear Bengal paddy farmers","Heavy rain for rest of monsoon might complete the deficit, says IMD, but will that be enough?

Kharif crops in West Bengal have been severely affected due to insufficient rain this monsoon season. Farmers in the state, especially in south Bengal, heavy losses as Aman paddy cultivation has been hit by rainfall deficit.

West Bengal has a deficit of 39 per cent, while south Bengal has a deficit of 47 per cent.

“Farmers have not been able to even sow the seeds due to the lack of rain,” said Anil Gope, a paddy farmer from Burdwan district.

Gope has 10 bighas of agricultural land. “There is no irrigation system here, so farming is completely dependent on rainwater,” he said. “If the rainfall becomes normal by August 15, I still have a chance to harvest crops. Else I will face huge losses.” A bigha of land is around 0.62 acres.

The farmer invests around Rs 60,000 on his farm every year. He will lose earnings for the entire year if there is no rain, as post-monsoon potato and mustard crops would also be affected.

Monsoon had a late start in the region this year, around June 18, which is a delay of 10 days, said GK Das, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Kolkata. This year, the monsoon is estimated to officially withdraw from Bengal on October 10.

“The overall deficiency is primarily caused by two reasons: Late onset of monsoon and no low-pressure area near Bangladesh or Bay of Bengal to bring more rain to West Bengal,” he said.

Low pressures in these areas lead to heavy to mid-level rain in south Bengal. A low-pressure area was created near the Andhra coast; therefore, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had enough rain in July, for example.

Monsoon 2022 is expected to be normal for Bengal, Das said. “However, two to three good depressions or low-pressure systems are needed for a normal monsoon,” he said.

There may be some heavy or continuous rains in the remaining days of July and all of August, September and the beginning of October, the weatherman added.

“As we are facing extreme weather events due to climate change. Continuous or heavy rainfall can help recover from the deficiency,” Das said

Major paddy-growing districts like Howrah, Hoogly, Nadia and Burdwan are already lagging in sowing this season compared to previous years.

“So far, I have not invested in Aman harvesting at all,” said Tosalia Dhabek from Nadia district’s Hanshkhali.

Dhabek has 10 bighas of agricultural land, and he usually harvests paddy on around half of it, investing around Rs 25,000.

“There is no rain and irrigation systems aren’t working as well in the absence of enough rain. Even if it rains at August-end, paddy farming is possible,” the farmer said.

“Then it will be mustard in September-October and again paddy in February,” Dhabek said. No Aman harvest will mean a huge setback for him.

Farmer Kartik Mandal from Hoogly district’s Khanakul has sown paddy seeds on three bighas of land, hoping for better rain. He has two acres where he also plants potatoes and almonds.

“I have to spend Rs 105 per litre of kerosene to run a water pump for my farm. On sowing days, the pump runs for four hours a day. This is impossible for small-scale farmers,” he said. Good rain for the rest of the monsoon will give him a chance to recover his money.

Mandal is a member of a cooperative society which gives him a loan of Rs 30,000 for Aman harvesting. He has sown 15 kilograms of paddy seeds, priced at Rs 105 per kg.

The farmer had already faced losses in his almond harvest earlier this year due to continuous rain at the end of April. Last year, he sold Rs 2,47,000 worth of almonds but didn’t even get a lakh rupees this time.

Another farmer complained that seeds are drying up due to lack of rain. “I have already sowed 22 kgs of paddy seeds on my six bighas. It will all be ruined if there is no rain. How will I survive,” asked Manotosh Dolui from Howrah district’s Amta.

Dolui has sown seeds priced 60 per kg in his low-lying land and seeds priced 72 per kg on the high ground. He usually invests Rs 40,000-50,000 for a return of around Rs 60,000-70,000, barely enough to sustain his family.

“Even irrigation systems need some good rain,” he said.

Like Mandal, Dolui also faced losses in his mustard and almond nuts.

However, he lost his crops to a lack of rain after March. “I only got 8-10 kgs of harvest per katha of land, instead of the usual 30-32 kgs,” he said. A katha is equal to 0.0165 acres of land.

Hingoli and Nanded districts in Marathwada were severely affected by the excess rain

Incessant rains this month in Maharashtra have damaged crops across 800,000 hectares. The heavy rains on July 11 and 12, 2022, have affected farmers in 24 districts, mostly in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions.

Paddy, corn, soyabean, cotton, tur and banana crops and other vegetables have been heavily damaged, according to the state agriculture department.

“Preliminary reports assessing the damage through July 21 show 796,218 hectares of agricultural land have been affected,” said a state agriculture department official.

Half the damage has been reported by Marathwada alone. Hingoli and Nanded districts have seen heavy damage.

“My division has registered losses on 377,870 hectares of land,” said an official from the agriculture department in Marathwada. “Over 100,000 farmers have been affected.”

The official said the revenue department has started assessing the damage and reports were being shared with the officials concerned.

“Around 4.8 million hectares of land is cultivated in the division, out of which 4.1 million had been sown before the rains,” the official said.

“About 1.2 million hectares were planted with cotton and soyabean on 2 million hectares. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of the crops are damaged,” he added.

Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal, Wardha, Nagpur, Bhandara, Gadchiroli and Chandrapur in Vidarbha region have also suffered heavy losses, along with Pune and Nashik in western and north Maharashtra.

The official said paddy, cotton and soyabean had been affected the most. “Groundnut, sugarcane, turmeric and jowar crops were destroyed too,” he added.

Marathwada has also lost a lot of cattle — 522 animals across eight districts. As many as 40 people have also died due to extreme weather conditions.

The state agriculture department official said it is too early to estimate the losses in terms of revenue.

“The actual revenue losses will only be realised once the crop damage across the state are assessed and reports received,” he said.

Aurangabad in Marathwada received 326 millimetre of rains, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD). This is 104 mm more than the average rainfall in the region.

Parbhani has recorded 487 mm rainfall — a deviation of 199 mm. Akola in Vidarbha region has received 700 mm of rainfall, which is a departure of 423 mm.",1
796742,"Deficient rainfall in Bihar, paddy farmers fear drought, crop loss","Most of Bihar’s 38 districts are facing rainfall deficit, according to IMD’s data

Paddy farmers in Bihar fear a drought and loss of their crops after the state recorded a large deficit in rainfall in the crucial first half of July.

Some 80-85 per cent of paddy farmers in Bihar have prepared seedlings (known locally as dhan bichra), according to Bihar’s agriculture secretary N Sarvana Kumar. Most farmers have prepared paddy seedlings on their small patches farmland.

But the transplantation of paddy seedlings has been done in only 0.67 million hectares (mha) of the total target of 3.52 mha. “If rainfall had been normal, nearly 40 per cent of paddy seedlings should have been transplanted so far,” an official told this reporter.

The transplantation of paddy seedlings is as low as five per cent in 15 districts and 10 per cent in 17 districts, according to the department. The transplantation of paddy seedlings was completed on 1.36 mha of 3.3 mha till July 16. In 2020, it was done on 1.76 mha of 3.3 mha.

Sanjay Kumar, an official at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Centre, Patna, said July 15, 2022, that Bihar recorded 194.6 millimetres (mm) of rainfall from June 1 to July 15.

This was 42 per cent less than the normal 335.6 mm of rainfall. The state has received only 22.4 mm rainfall from July 1-15, which is 87 per cent less than the normal 172.4 mm.

Most of Bihar’s 38 districts are facing rainfall deficit, according to IMD’s data. The deficit in Araria, Purnea, Madhepura, Bhagalpur, Buxar and Supaul is nearly 97 per cent to 95 per cent.

The deficit in other districts is 90 to above 60 per cent, except Kaimur, where deficient rainfall is 32 per cent, the lowest in the state.

Hundreds of thousands of farmers across Bihar are facing a difficult situation due to the rainfall deficit.

Praying for rain

Pramod Singh and Lakhan Prasad, both marginal farmers of Karpi block in Arwal district, fear a drought as there has virtually been no rain in the last 15 days in July.

“Our farmland and paddy seedlings are ready for transplantation. But we are yet to start transplantation due to lack of water and rainfall deficit,” Singh, a resident of Katesar village, said.

“We farmers are waiting for rain even during the month of Sawan (Shravana) to start the much-awaited paddy seedlings transplantation. If the long dry spell continues for one more week, a drought is certain,” Prasad, a resident of Kinjar village, said.

Even big and well-off landowners, who managed to complete paddy transplantation by using diesel pump sets and electric-run motors, are worried about the rainfall situation.

“We have used a diesel pump set to avail water and complete paddy seedlings transplantation. But we are not sure how long they will survive without rain,” Shivnath Pandey, a farmer of Kutumba block in Aurangabad district, said.

It is not easy to pull out ground water daily as water evaporates from farmland due to the hot and humid climate, Pandey added.

“There is no water in the canal because the water resources department has failed to discharge water for irrigation purposes despite no rainfall,” Dhananjay Kumar, a farmer of Bala Bigha under Haspura block in Aurangabad, said.

Aurangabad has recorded a deficit of 85 per cent. So far, nearly one per cent of paddy seedling transplantation has been completed in the district.

Aurangabad district agriculture officer Ranveer Kr Singh said he had appealed to all farmers to save their paddy seedlings and keep them alive for transplantation as rainfall was expected next week.

Khagaria district agriculture officer Shailesh Kumar said paddy seedlings transplantation was badly hit by poor monsoon.

Dinkar Prasad, Katihar district agriculture officer, said nearly 32 per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted so far. The transplantation process was getting delayed due to deficient rainfall, he added.

Nearly 25 per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted till date in Supaul, Kirshi Vigyan Kendra’s scientist Manoj Kumar, said.

In several districts including Jamui, Nawada and Banka, farmers have been struggling to keep their paddy seedlings green as they turn yellow due to lack of water.

“My farmland is dry. Even the nursery of paddy seedlings has developed cracks because of no rain since the last two weeks. Am doing everything to save them. But this is a challenge as temperatures are hovering at 35-37°C,” Musafir Mahto, a marginal farmer of Sinhauli village in Nawada, said.

Mahto said hardly one per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted in his area.

N Sarvana Kumar said this past week that so far, only 15-20 per cent of the transplantation of paddy seedlings had been completed. The agriculture department has targeted 3.52 million hectares for paddy cultivation this year.

The state’s agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh said the government was aware of the situation and asked district officers to provide help to farmers by ensuring supply of power and other measures.

Bihar’s farmers are heavily dependent on monsoon rain for kharif crops, mainly paddy, a water-intensive crop.

In the last 13 years, monsoon rainfall has been above normal five times in June. In 2021, Bihar received 111 per cent surplus rainfall, 82 per cent in 2020, 37 per cent in 2011, 5 per cent in 2013 and 6 per cent in 2022.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal during July and August. But surplus rainfall in June resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.",1
796840,Fall Armyworm attack: 'Eastern India more vulnerable to infestation',"Warmer temperatures increase the metabolism and reproductive rates of the pest

Fall Armyworm was first reported in July 2018 in Karnataka. Ever since, it has spread to its neighbouring states. Reports are now coming from West Bengal and Bihar as well. The initial damages are widespread as the pest is a voracious feeder. But we have reacted quickly. The Karnataka government, for example, has issued ad hoc recommendations for emergency response against it.



The worm has six stages of development, each of these occupying a different part of the plant. The larvae hatch in the older leaves and then move up the tree as they grow older. The adult larva eats maize cob and leaves and then drops into the soil, staying there for 10 days before emerging as an adult. But quick steps can avert major losses even if the infestation is intense.



Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are currently witnessing greatest infestation, but the eastern side of the country is more vulnerable to the pest because it has more favourable environmental conditions and several host species. Warmer temperatures increase the metabolism and reproductive rates of the pest. It means the pest's lifecycle will be completed in a shorter time, leading to more generations per crop. This will intensify the infestation. Even 10C increase in the global temperature would mean warmer regions and higher humidity levels, which will allow Fall Armyworm to flourish. Untimely rains and wind, also related to climate change, will benefit the pest.

Transplantation of paddy seedlings after August 15 is not desirable for quality yields and production. Photo: iStock

Paddy farmers in Bihar are worried as the state has recorded deficit rainfall since June this year. Paddy fields are dry and have developed huge cracks, an alarming situation for rainfed rice growers.

The transplantation of paddy seedlings has been done in 78.28 per cent of the total target as of August 15, 2022. The seedlings were transplanted in 2.748 million hectares (MHA) of 3.512 MHA this year, according to the official data of the state agriculture department.

The farmers could not sow paddy in 0.763 MHA this Kharif season due to the lack of rain. A large tract of agricultural land, nearly 22 per cent of the target, was directly affected by deficient rainfall.

Transplantation after Sawan (the second and final monsoon month, according to the traditional calendar), which ends August 12, is not good according to tradition.

It is also not desirable for quality yields and production if done after August 15, experts say.

The department said transplantation was completed in only four of Bihar’s 38 districts. These include Kishanganj, Purnea, Katihar and Araria. The process has been below the expected normal in nine districts, including Jamui, Banka, Munger, Nawada, Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura, Gaya and Aurangabad.

Suresh Yadav, a marginal farmer from Aurangabad, told this reporter:

After a dry Sawan, the ongoing Bhadon month has also been dry. This is something unusual. Our paddy cultivation mainly depends on normal rainfall during Sawan and Bhadon. We have transplanted paddy seedlings using groundwater using a costly diesel pump. With a long dry spell, farmers will have to struggle to save paddy.

”The transplantation was delayed due to rainfall deficit and now, a major challenge is to keep alive the hope that there will be rainfall in the third and fourth weeks of August and in September,” he added.

Farmers in Jamui district, which has the lowest paddy transplantation, have been demanding that the government declares a drought.

“We are not able to cultivate paddy on our land. We are facing drought and the government should take measures to help us,” Kuldip Mandal, a farmer, said.

About 20 districts in Bihar have received less than the average rainfall so far. Twelve districts have received less than 50 per cent of normal rainfall, said officials from the disaster management department.

Bihar recorded 389.5 millimetres (mm) of rainfall from June 1 through August 16. This was 40 per cent less than the normal, 648.3 mm of rainfall, said Sanjay Kumar, an official at the India Meteorological Department, Patna.

“The monsoon system is weak over Bihar and there is little possibility of heavy rainfall in the coming days. Deficient rainfall is unlikely to change much unless a strong monsoon system develops,” added Kumar.

Farmers are hapless due to deficient rainfall as they depend heavily on the monsoon for paddy cultivation. The government last month decided to increase diesel subsidy for irrigation to Rs 75 per litre from the earlier approved Rs 60.

Bihar’s Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, expressed concern over deficient rainfall twice in the last month while meeting with top officials to review the situation.

He had directed the officials to ensure power supply in rural areas and adequate water to the farms up to the tail-end of canals for irrigation.

But a month after this, the reality is something different. The power supply is inadequate in rural areas and canals are devoid of water.

Farmers blame the government for failing to provide adequate power supply and water in canals. In a few places, farmers have protested against the same.

“Most of the 23 reservoirs in the state are either dry or have little water. Last year, most reservoirs had over 50 per cent water by this time, so dry spells during the sowing season were well taken care of,” an official of the water resources department (WRD) said.

Of the 23 reservoirs in the state, barely three have water levels over 40 per cent, while some are almost dry or have less than 10 per cent, according to WRD.

The farmers have been facing a difficult situation and the government is aware of it, said Bihar agriculture minister, Sudhakar Singh.

“I have taken oath as a minister only the day before. The department will now take some decisions to help farmers, who are still looking at the sky and clouds for rains,” he added.

Bihar farmers usually go for paddy sowing after June 20. “Those farmers who have transplanted paddy seedlings in July or early August are still waiting for heavy rainfall.

Adequate watering is a must for paddy during Sawan and Bhadon. Crops will dry or get damaged if water is inadequate,” said Akhilesh Mahto, a small farmer from the Patna district.

A large part of Bihar is in the grip of a drought-like situation. The government will sooner or later have no other option but to declare at least over a dozen districts drought-hit, if not the entire state.

An estimated two-thirds of Bihar’s 120 million population and nearly two-thirds of all agricultural activity depends on agriculture.",1
796927,Assam to revist Kharif crop calendar to counter effects of erratic monsoon,"Yield of rice, the state's major crop, has been affected by unpredictable rainfall patterns

The Assam government has planned to revise the crop calendar for the state’s Kharif crops, with an aim to align its cropping cycle with the erratic nature of the monsoon. The revision is especially needed for paddy, the state’s major crop grown over 70-80 per cent of its area.

A crop calendar typically has information on sowing and harvesting windows of a particular crop, depending on the parameters of rainfall and temperature in a particular region. This information is conveyed to the farmers in the form of advisories.

Assam’s agriculture department, along with the Assam Agriculture University (AAU), recently sought this revision from the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA). Following this, a committee was formed to look at the kind of change in rainfall pattern and temperature in the state.

Pre-monsoon (March-May) and monsoon (June-September) are the two important rainfall seasons for Assam, said Kuldeep Medhi, junior scientist, agriculture meteorology, AAU. “We have been noticing an abnormal trend for the last five-six years: While the Kharif crops are flooded one year, they encounter drought like situation in another.”

Thus, it has become important to revisit the existing sowing windows of different crops, he added.

There has been a decrease in total volume of rainfall in the six agroclimatic zones of the state, the scientist said, adding:

The small rainy day events are reducing and extreme events are becoming more prominent. This pattern is being seen during the pre-monsoon period as well for some districts. Other districts, however, are getting maximum pre-monsoon precipitation. This has affected rice yield.

Rice is the main crop for Assam, contributing 96 per cent of the total food grain production of the state. Rice is broadly grown in three seasons: Sali (June / July to November / December), Ahu (March / April to June / July) and Boro (November / December to May / June).

“Among the three, the cultivation of Sali rice follows throughout different districts of the state whereas the other two ae confined to a few districts,” said Medhi.

Farmers in the state are already adapting various climate-resilient practices at their own level. Families in Nepali Pathar, Banai and Nalbari villages in Dhemaji, one of the most flood-affected districts, are cultivating more rabi crops than kharif,

“We have also shifted more land towards cultivation of boro rice, which is sown in November and harvested by April or May,” Swadesh Hajong of Nalbari village said.

The traditional variety of Kharif paddy is usually the one to get damaged by floods. “We have started cultivating vegetables such as potato, tomato, eggplant, okra and peas instead of Kharif paddy, which is slowly fading,” he added.

People are also taking up mustard and pulses cultivation and resorting to rearing ducks, Hajong said.

There is a need for such a relook for the entire country, according to Santanu Bal, principal scientist at ICAR-CRIDA, who is heading the committee for revising the crop calendar for Assam. He said:

Rainfed crops cannot be sown as per the normal sowing dates anymore. And some districts and states are revisiting the calendar at their own levels.

Assam is the first state to formally approach CRIDA, Bal added.

The National Rainfed Area Authority, in its most recent draft policy published in July 2022, also highlighted the need for cross-country examination of the crop calendar.

“Long-term data for India indicates that rainfed areas experience three-four drought years per decade. Of these, two-three are moderate and one or two are severe in intensity,” the authority said.

Rainfed crops are likely to be worst hit due to limited options of coping with variability of rainfall and temperature, it added. “This may result in a shift in sowing time and shorter growing season, which may necessitate effective adjustment in sowing and harvesting dates.”

Increasing intra-seasonal variability of rainfall has become a major concern, according to the draft.",0

It has been raining heavily in many parts of the country. However, almost half of India’s biggest state, Uttar Pradesh, is facing drought-like conditions because of inadequate rainfall so far, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

The IMD has reported that 41 of 42 districts in eastern Uttar Pradesh, except Varanasi, are reeling under severe rain shortfall. The eastern UP subdivision has an overall rain deficit of 67 per cent as of July 14, 2022, according to IMD.

Most farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh are apprehensive about sowing their crops and have therefore refrained from taking up sowing. The major worry is over kharif crops, especially paddy.

Ajit Pratap, a farmer from Jalaun district, has still not sown his Basmati crop on his 10-hectare (ha) land as he anticipates the prevalence of drought-like conditions for some more time.

“We have not seen enough rain till now. And from what we hear in the forecasts, it won’t be raining much this time for the rest of the monsoon too,” he said dejectedly. Forty per cent of farmers in Pratap’s village grow paddy and most of them are waiting for the monsoon to begin.

According to Pratap, the window for sowing the crop is closing, as it usually is 130-140 days.

“If it doesn’t rain in the next 10 days, I won’t be able to plant it for the entire season. Or else, the sowing of Rabi crops will be affected,” he added.

Buddh Singh Kushwaha, a peppermint and sesame farmer from Bhanga village, had prepared his 1.6 ha land for sowing, when it rained for a brief span. “I thought that the monsoon was finally here and I was preparing for sowing. But it hasn’t rained at all since then. Last year, I was done with sowing by this time,” he said.

Peppermint, Kushwaha’s main kharif crop, takes 90 days to mature and has to be sown just like paddy — preparing a nursery and then transplanting. “It needs a good amount of water. Only farmers who have some other sources of water like tubewells could afford to sow at this time,” he said.

Many farmers Down To Earth spoke to have said some canals are dry and the government authorities have not yet released the water from those which have some storage. Farmers also said they did not get any specific advisories about the delay in the monsoon.

Meanwhile, there has also been a shift from the soyabean crop to sesame and urad (black gram) because of the low availability of water.

“Some 80 per cent of farmers in the Bundelkhand region used to sow soyabean as their main kharif crop. But now, they have shifted to crops that require less water,” Manvendra Singh from Parmarth Samaj Sevi Sansthan, which works with farmers in Bundelkhand, said.

The organisation has toured 76 villages in the region and found that around 15-20 per cent farmers in UP’s portion of Bundelkhand had not sown at all this time.

Also, many farmers who sowed their crops in anticipation of rain, now face the risk of crop failure. “It was being said earlier that the monsoon will come by July 1. So, many farmers sowed their crops,” Singh said.

The threat of losing rabi crops is another fear that farmers have. If it doesn’t rain much, it might affect their Rabi crops as well since they depend on groundwater for the rabi season.

“The groundwater will not get recharged if the monsoon continues the same way,” Ram Kishore, a farmer from Fatehpur district, said.

Western Uttar Pradesh too is facing a 55 per cent rain deficit. But the farmers there said they had irrigation facilities, due to which they managed to sow their crops on time.

Sitamram Mishra, head of the department of agriculture and meteorology at the Acharya Narendra Dev University of Agriculture and Technology in Ayodhya, said there was 30 per cent less transplantation this time, owing to scanty rainfall.

“The most affected are the marginal and small farmers who have no source of irrigation. These farmers are completely dependent on rainfall for their crops. Therefore no district in UP receiving normal rainfall till now is a matter of concern,” he said.

However, he was positive that the rains would start in the next four to five days. But he cautioned farmers intending to take up sowing in the coming days to go for medium or short duration varieties.",0

798495,Some eastern States to get lower rainfall in August,"Share this

02 August 2022, New Delhi: August is likely to have normal rainfall between 94-106 per cent of the long period average (LPA) of 254.9 mm, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Monday, releasing its monthly monsoon forecast for this month.

However, below-normal rain in Bihar and Jharkhand may not help paddy sowing to cover the deficit in the last two months. But, the normal rain forecast for east Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal has raised hope that already transplanted paddy crops will be saved and also it may help speed up sowing operation as well.

Odisha and Chhattisgarh may also get below-normal rainfall this month, which is not seen as good for the paddy since these two States have also seen deficit in acreage, although not much.

Bihar badly hit

Releasing the monthly forecast, IMD Director-General Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said: “Below normal rainfall is likely over the west coast and many areas of east-central as well as in the east and north-east region during August.”

He said normal to above normal rainfall is very likely over most parts of the south-east and north-west regions of India, apart from the western parts of central region.

Acreage of paddy, maize, groundnut and arhar has been trailing their year-ago levels mainly due to lower rainfall or shifting to other alternative crops.

Bihar had targetted 41.28 lakh hectares (lh) sowing areas to be covered under all crops this kharif season whereas only 47 per cent of the targetted area has been planted until July 28. Out of 35.12 lh targetted for paddy, only 15.69 lh has been covered, so far. Five districts – Aurangabad, Banka, Gaya, Jamui and Nawada, together having 17 per cent share in the state’s paddy area, have reported completion in only 6 per cent of their combined targetted area of 5.85 lh, so far.

“Rainfall over the country as a whole during the August-September period of the southwest monsoon season is most likely to be normal (94-106 per cent of LPA),” Mohapatra said.

As the country also faced flash floods in many parts this year leading to inundation of crops in some States, the IMD DG pointed out that number of weather stations reporting extremely heavy rainfall (more than 204.5 mm) has increased to 80 in June this year compared with 35-36 stations in the same month in previous two years. In July, such incidents reported by 131 weather stations this year whereas 121 incidents in same month 2021.

798535,Climate change and heat stress on crops poses a serious threat to agriculture. Can seaweed extracts help?,"Share this

25 July 2022, US: Climate change and rising temperatures with associated consequences pose a serious threat to natural systems and socioeconomic well-being. The agricultural sector, in particular, is very sensitive to climate change. Even a small increase of 1° to 2°C can have significant negative effects on crop yields. Global economic losses in the production of three major crops (wheat, corn, and barley) attributed to climate change are estimated at approximately US$ 5 billion per year.

Climate change impacts agriculture and resulting changes in production patterns and prices affect both producers and consumers, changing the profitability of agricultural production and the share of income spent on food. If food prices increase because of climate change impacts, households not only will have to spend more income on food consumption but also could face a risk of nutritional shortage and insufficient access to food.

Due to the continuous rise of global temperatures and heatwaves worldwide, as a result of climate change, concerns around this topic are at an all-time high. Heat stress impairs the stability of cell membranes and many biological processes within plants. Whether in the presence or absence of adequate soil moisture, heat stress can be an important risk and/or limitation to plant growth and development. Crop yield is reduced by heat and water stress and even more when these conditions co-occur, impacting photosynthesis and reproduction.

A novel solution for managing heat stress in crops

An innovative agronomic tool that can be used as a strategy to counteract the detrimental effects of abiotic stresses, including heat stress, is biostimulants such as Acadian Plant Health’s seaweed extracts. “We have been able to study the effect of our seaweed extract, Ascophyllum nodosum, on plants experiencing heat stress. With our unique extraction process, we are able to liberate numerous bioactive compounds such as mannitol, polysaccharides, and betaines. These compounds have shown to improve plant tolerance to stressful growing conditions, including, but not limited to, heat stress and drought,” says Dr. Holly Little. “Mannitol is critical in protecting the cell water balance in stress situations to prevent cell water loss. Key polysaccharides elicit antioxidant production which keeps cell integrity and neutralizes free radicals. Proline production also strengthens cell wall membranes, protects key metabolic enzymes, and mediates water balance in stress situations to prevent cell water loss. And lastly, our seaweed extract contains natural betaines, while also eliciting betaine production. This again prevents cell water loss due to dry or salty environments and balances cell water content for great photosynthesis,” says Dr. Little.

In a study conducted by Acadian Plant Health™, three-week-old soybean plants were placed in a growth chamber set at 27°C for a 16-hour day length. Plants were treated with fertilizer alone vs. fertilizer plus Acadian Plant Health seaweed extract. In this video, you can see the temperature of the plants as they become exposed to heat and water stress.

The plants treated with Acadian Plant Health seaweed extracts were significantly cooler than the untreated plants. When plants are rewatered, a larger percentage of the leaves on the treated plant recover, and the plant is able to return to normal functioning – transpiring to cool leaf temperature much faster than the control.

“Drought alone causes more annual loss in crop yield than all pathogens combined. Add in heat stress and you have a major impact that is difficult to recover from,” says Dr. Little. “There continues to be a need to produce high-yielding plants that use water more efficiently than their present-day counterparts. The use of biostimulants like seaweed extracts could be an underutilized solution for the agricultural industry. Our research efforts will continue to be focused on uncovering the physiology of the plant response to our seaweed extract concerning climate-induced stressors such as heat and drought. To ensure food security we must deliver new strategies to combat scarcity.”

In view of the rising water levels in the Yamuna and Betwa rivers, a flood alert has been sounded in UP districts which are located on the banks of the rivers.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath issued special instructions for districts connected with the rivers and asked district magistrates to remain alert regarding floods.

Water levels in the Yamuna and Betwa rivers are rapidly rising due to the release of water from Rajasthan. Dams and barrages of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Delhi NCR are releasing about 20.5 lakh cubic seconds of water each second into the Yamuna.

CM YOGI ISSUES INSTRUCTIONS

In view of the possible danger of flooding, CM Yogi has asked officials to make arrangements for the safety of residents. He issued instructions to district magistrates of Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Auraiya, Jalaun, Hamirpur, Banda, Prayagraj, Mathura and Mirzapur.

NDRF and SDRF teams should be alert in the affected districts, said CM, adding that PAC and disaster management teams should also be alert.

CM emphasised that help should be provided for the affected families and the relief control room should be functional to monitor the situation.

798742,Paddy sowing takes a hit as Jharkand reports 47% less rain,"Over 1.7 million hectares of farmlands left unsown

Over 1.7 million hectares of Jharkhand’s cultivable land is yet to be sown as the state has received 47 per cent less rainfall this season.

Many states in India are facing the same issue of losing crops due to a deficit in the rainfall this season.

Farmers in Jharkhand have been waiting for rain for the past several days to sow their crops, said Manoj Konbegi, a farmer from Simdega district. For the past seven days, rainy clouds gather but get blown away by eastern winds, he said.

Only about 2-5 per cent of paddy had been sown in the entire district, Konbegi added. “I am worried about the expenses for the entire year,” he said.

The state’s agriculture department said that through July 11, 16 districts received 51-79 per cent less rainfall than usual. Sahebganj district has fared the worst.

Seraikela-Kharsawa, Dhanbad, Ranchi, Bokaro, Dumka and Giridih districts have received 30-47 per cent less rainfall.

Sowing targets seem unattainable

The state had a target of sowing Kharif crops in 28,27,460 hectares by July 11. Paddy was to be grown in 1.8 million hectares and maize in over 312,560 hectares.

Pulses were to be grown in 612,900 hectares, millets in 42,000 hectares and oilseeds in 60,000 hectares.

However, the situation is starkly different this time. Even half of the sowing has not been done compared to last year.

Paddy has been sown in just 96,547 hectares, maize in 103,862 hectares and millets in 3,577 hectares. Oilseeds have been sown in just 15,247 hectares as well.

According to the agriculture department, paddy was grown in 216,210 hectares and maize in 97,374 hectares in the last Kharif season.

Pulses grew in 58,966 hectares, millets in 1,288 hectares and oil seeds in 14,129 hectares.

Last year, it had rained more than usual. By the beginning of July last year, paddy seedlings had been sown in 13 districts.

Till now, 27,000 quintals of paddy seeds have been distributed by the government to only one lakh farmers.

Seeds had been distributed to farmers using blockchain technology, said Raghu Oraon, a farmer from Ranchi. “Many farmers do not understand how to connect using blockchain, so we bought seeds from the market,” he said.

Director for Agriculture and Horticulture, Jharkhand, said that the method was being used to distribute seeds to farmers in a transparent way.

In the method, an online tracking system provides information about where, when and how the seeds will reach. Farmers are being registered for blockchain distribution.

Farmers waiting for rains

Paddy seedlings are ready for transplantation, but no workers are out in the fields, said a farmer from Lohardaga district.

“We can’t control the rains. The Almighty God might make it rain very late this year; we are just waiting for it,” said Nilima Tigga, adding that she has not thought about what to do if it does not rain at all.

Tigga is also a member of the district advisory committee.

The animal husbandry department has advised rearing chickens, goats and ducks if farmers can’t grow Kharif crops. The department would provide loans for it, said Tigga.

“I am currently preparing to sow finger millets and pulses, as these crops don’t need rains, just moisture,” said Another farmer from the district, Charo Bhagat. “However, if paddy sowing doesn’t happen properly this year, the farmers will be in a lot of trouble.”

Konbegi said that many farmers had not even prepared paddy seedlings. Transplantation has only happened in places right next to dams.

“Farms on elevated lands can use machines to water their farmlands, but the low-lying farms can’t do that. If it rains after sowing, the crops will be ruined,” he said.

Konbegi said paddy farmlands need a consistent two to three inches of water at all times.

There is no clear data on the number of farmers in Jharkhand. Over three million farmers are registered with PM-KISAN. PM-KISAN is a central sector scheme to supplement the financial needs of land-holding farmers.

However, in 2021, Chief Minister Hemant Soren announced that Kisan Credit Cards would be distributed to 5.8 million farmers. Later, he also announced Birsa Unique ID Cards for 3.5 million farmers.

The Jharkhand government had recently called a meeting to discuss the situation of the Kharif crop and rains.

Agriculture director Nesha Oraon said that the government is keeping an eye on the matter. “For the time being, we have advised farmers to plant short-duration seeds,” she said.

“Paddy varieties like Anjali, Lalat, Vandana, Birsa Sugandha, etc can be grown. We have also advised planting Drot tolerance variety, IR-64(DRT) and related seeds,” she said, adding that there can be a good yield with mulching methods.",0
798745,Dry to deluge: Incessant rain a threat to Marathwada farmers,"After scanty rainfall in June & early July, Maharashtra region now has a problem of too much downpour in too short a span

Large parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha have been severely affected by the incessant rain

Incessant rain in Marathwada, which was going dry not so long ago, has turned a threat to farmers.

Rain in the last 15 days has damaged about 100,000 acres of agricultural land in Maharashtra, according to officials. Vidarbha region has also reported major losses.

The state received over 35 per cent more rainfall in July, recording 459 mm against the expected rain of 340 mm. Several districts reported rainfall 200 per cent above average.

The weather conditions are likely to persist through July 16.

A farmer from Kurunda village in Marathwada said the erratic rains had destroyed 15 acres of crops. “I lost my soybean and turmeric plots overnight due to the unceasing rains on July 12,” lamented Ashok Dalvi.

Dalvi had been eagerly waiting for the monsoons for respite but has now lost all hopes of a successful harvest. He had spent Rs 70,000 on sowing and fertilisers. “The excessive rains have washed my investment down the drain,” he told Down to Earth.

Farmers said their crops had been destroyed by the deluge

About 55 per cent of Marathwada region and around 40 per cent of Vidarbha has been severely affected by the rain, said Dheeraj Kumar, state agriculture commissioner. Around 100,000 acres of agricultural land has been destroyed, he said.

Kumar said Aurangabad district has received 206 per cent more rainfall in July already, with 132 mm rainfall against the 68 mm average.

The official record from the divisional commissioners showed that rain in Hingoli district deviated by 303 per cent, recording 353 mm rain against an expected 116.

Kalamnuri taluka saw 431 per cent excess rain, while Basmat saw 274 per cent more rainfall. Aundha and Sengaon talukas also received 285.5 per cent and 268.2 per cent excess rain, respectively.

The scenarios in other districts were similar. Drought-affected Latur received 66.8 mm of rain in 24 hours, Osmanabad had 42.5 mm.

Nanded district received an average of 123mm rainfall over a 24-hour period, officials had reported on July 13.

The head of the Kurunda village, Rajesh Patil, said that 20,000 farmers in Hingoli district are facing a fate similar to Dalvi.

“The entire village is affected because of the incessant rains,” said Patil. “The agricultural land is submerged, plots and cattle have been washed away and there is no guarantee that resowing will lead to a harvest.”

The rain over the last fortnight has affected 70 per cent of agriculture production in Marathwada, said Jayajirao Suryawanshi, a farmer activist.

“Incessant rainfall in various pockets has damaged crops like tur dal and cotton. Meanwhile, several parts of the region have not received rain. These farmers are also staring at heavy losses,” he said.

Suryawanshi claimed that several suicides by farmers had also been reported.

Official figures from the divisional commissionerate showed that as many as 306 cases of farmer suicides had been confirmed in Aurangabad for June.

The erratic rains have made farming a hazardous profession, Suryawanshi told DTE.

“Marathwada did not receive much rain in June and early July. But the rain intensity increased in the last few days and covered the deficit. But rains like these can lead to crop damage instead of being beneficial,” he said.

He said that farmers would be in an even trickier situation if rains pause entirely for the next 15 days of the month.

Areas that received more than 90mm of rainfall within 24 hours can be categorised as having received excessive rainfall, said Uday Deolankar, former agriculture advisor with the state government.

“However, the areas that have received it traditionally receive more rain,” Deolankar added.

The cause of excess rain

An increase in the severity of east-moving easterly winds and west-moving winds, or westerlies, have caused high-pressure conditions in central Maharashtra, causing rains, Deolankar said.

But the expert pointed out that rains recorded in low-intensity regions have also resulted in flooding or water stagnation.

This is because the concentration time has been reduced. “The time of concentration is the period required for rains to drop in the catchment area and flow downstream,” he said.

There are fewer hurdles due to rapid urbanisation and surface run-off allows water to flow faster, leading to flooding.

He added that delays in monsoons have already pushed the sowing season and the incessant rains may lead to losses.

“The rainy conditions are likely to improve after July 14. The rainfall and the weather conditions in the next two days will help us understand the gravity of losses,” Deolankar said.

Kumar said the data had been shared with the officials concerned, who will estimate the losses and issue guidelines for compensation to farmers.",1
798747,Monsoon 2022: Agriculture sector shed nearly 8 million jobs in June,"Sluggish monsoon; area sown down 15%; rural employment stares at meltdown

There are disturbing signals of a potential meltdown of the country’s biggest employer and also food producer as the southwest monsoon enters its second week of the second month.

Kharif sowing was down 15 per cent by July 7, in comparison to last year for the same period. Altogether, farmers didn’t sow in 6.3 million hectares (Ha) of farms.

Sowing is picking up at snail’s pace, with the first two weeks of June reporting insignificant activities. In a normal season, the main crop of paddy would have been transplanted from the nursery by this time.

Planting is the most labour-intensive phase of agriculture, particularly for paddy crops. The sluggish sowing progress is already reflecting in the overall unemployment situation of the country.

Mahesh Vyas, managing director and chief executive of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE), has flagged dire consequences in his analysis of the unemployment scenario in June.

“Rains were 32 per cent below normal during the first fortnight (of June). This could have slowed the deployment of labour to the fields. The agricultural sector shed nearly eight million jobs in June. These were mostly in plantations,” Vyas wrote while releasing the CMIE’s latest assessment of the employment situation.

Most of the employment during this phase of the kharif season is for plantation labourers or transplanting from nurseries. CMIE said cultivation could add just four million jobs during June. This was lower than the figures in the same month in 2021 and 2020.

Overall, the unemployment situation in the country was so acute that the CMIE assessment showed people had stopped looking for jobs, or they had quit the labour market.

This happens when one is not hopeful of getting employment and s/he is just discouraged enough to not even seek jobs. Labour force is defined as the sum total of people looking for a job.

In June, the labour force had 10 million fewer people seeking employment. “While about 13 million lost jobs during the month, the count of the unemployed increased by only three million. The rest exited the labour markets. As a result, the labour force shrunk by 10 million in June 2022,” CMIE said.

But what makes the June situation alarming is the fact that almost all the 13 million jobs lost were in rural areas. And most of these jobs were lost in the agriculture sector.

What does this signify? First, the biggest employer — the agriculture sector — is shedding jobs. So, it will have an overall impact on rural income.

Second, the late sowing and potentially low agricultural income means the return on farmers’ investment would be less thus adding to their debt. Usually, farmers make their biggest investments at the time of sowing: Seeds and hiring labourers and also preparing the farms.

Third, and the most troubling, is the fact that a farmer earns more from wage than from cultivation. Thus, the huge dip in agricultural labour jobs in June means that people have not earned anything for a good one month.

That month is also one of the biggest earning months in the five-month agriculture season. This will impact the overall income of the people from farming.

The CMIE latest data shows that the farm labourers were the worst-hit. “While the agricultural sector as a whole shed jobs, people engaged as farmers increased by 1.8 million. Implicitly, the fall in employment in the agricultural sector was among agricultural labourers,” CMIE said.

This could mean that more people have joined farming just being in villages. Many of the farm owners themselves have done the manual work, displacing the usual labourers hired to save cost or just to be engaged.

This vacuum in the job market could be sensed from the fact that in June, the demand for work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme had shot up to unprecedented levels.

Some 31 million people sought work in June, on the back of demand from 30 million people in May, Down To Earth reported. The high demand for jobs under the MGNREGA shows that informal workers stay put in villages, unable to find any jobs outside.

However, as government data from the Union rural development ministry points out, the rural wage programme is also not able to meet the demand.

The revival of the rural labour market now entirely depends on the progress of the monsoon and importantly, fast progress in sowing.

Sowing has just begun in many states, as farmers wait till the monsoon progresses after the June deficit phase. But, in July and August, the monsoon also enters into many ‘breaks’. Like in recent years, large-scale crop damages have been reported during such ‘breaks’. What if the monsoon behaves this way this year as well?",1
798749,Scanty June rain forces MP farmers to sow paddy a second time,"The state received about 23% less rainfall than average till June 28, 2022, resulting in wilting of crops; farmers have had to borrow money to sow their fields again

Irregular rains in June have thrown a spanner in the works in the plans of Madhya Pradesh’s farmers, with many having to take loans to sow their fields again.

The southwest monsoon officially arrived in MP June 20. MP was supposed to receive 116 millimetres (mm) of rain till June 28, according to the India Meteorological Department.

But it has received only 89 mm. The figure is 23 per cent less than usual. Last year recorded more than 100 mm of rain until the said date.

Some districts have reported intermittent rainfall. Crops sown in the first week of June are drying up. Seeds of those farmers who had sown in dry fields, expecting rain, are also getting spoiled. Those who have not sown yet are also concerned.

Farmers’ woes

Gulab Rao Kapse of Athne, Betul district, had sown three quintals of soybean in a 9-acre field between June 8 and June 12. However, the crop has since deteriorated.

The soyabean seeds were worth Rs 49,000. Diesel and labour costs totalled Rs 10,000 and Rs 1,800, respectively. A fair amount of work was done by the household members themselves.

The household incurred expenses totalling about Rs one lakh by including both, outside costs and household member salaries. The seed did not germinate.

So, Kapse took a loan of Rs 35,000 from a relative and bought new seeds. On June 27, Kapse again sowed his field. Bu this time, he planted half the field with maize and the other half with soyabean.

Basant Kumar, a farmer of Charkheda village in Harda district, said he has 20 acres of land. Groundnut and soyabean have each been planted on 10 acres.

The last day of sowing was June 20. The crop did not come out well. Re-sowing will have to be done if there is no rain in the next two days. He estimates the cost per acre to be around Rs 15,000. Other farmers’ crops in the area have also suffered damage.

Raja Mandloi, a farmer from Barwani district, said his area was receiving unusual rainfall. Those farmers who had good irrigation facilities had planted cotton on time.

Those without access to water were waiting for ‘good rain’. He claimed that 50 per cent of the sowing was yet to be done. Mandloi is concerned that if the onset of good rain is delayed further, the crop cycle, and thus, the rabi season crop will be affected.

Surendra Rajput, a farmer living in Bairakhedi of Dolaria tehsil of Narmadapuram district, said he had sown paddy in 18 acres.

Monsoon occurring in the past years in MP Year Date of onset of monsoon 2016 June 21 2017 June 26 2018 June 27 2019 June 28 2020 June 15 2021 June 11 2022 June 20

He had spent Rs 1,700 per acre on seeds, Rs 1,350 on fertilisers, Rs 1,500 on diesel and Rs 1,200 on labour. There had been no rain for a week. Some paddy seeds had sprouted and some had not. “There is concern that the seeds will be ruined,” Rajput said.

Jagdish Singh, a farmer of Chhatarpur district, said there had been a light spell of rain in his district. “There is not enough moisture in the ground yet. Since sowing the crop is not an option, all farmers are waiting at the moment,” Singh said.

He expressed concern over the delayed seeding of the kharif crop. “If you seed this late, the crop will arrive even later. The schedule for sowing rabi season crops such as gram, wheat and mustard will then be disturbed,” he said.

Madhya Pradesh typically sows 13.9 million hectares (mha) of kharif. But last year, 14.5 mha were sown, leading to this year’s goal of planting 14.78 mha.

Till June 25, 2021, 1.27 mha of land had been planted in the state, as compared to this year’s 0.91 mha.",0
798779,Summer crops may be damaged this year due to temperature rise: Experts,"States accuse the Centre of not taking any initiative to help them increase production of summer crops

Agricultural experts have warned that an unusually hot March and April this year may cause damage to summer crops, which are grown in the Indian subcontinent between ‘Rabi’ (winter) and ‘Kharif’ (monsoon) crops.

States have also accused the Centre of not taking any initiative to help them increase production of summer crops such as pulses, oilseeds and nutritional cereals.

Summer crop sowing starts in the last week of February or first week of March and these crops are harvested by May-June.

The government and farmers are concerned about the summer crops this year. Experts say the maximum temperature for summer crops is 35 degrees Celsius. They add that the crops will be damaged if the temperature reaches more than 40°C.

Aditya Pratap, principal scientist at the Indian Institute of Pulses Research, Kanpur, told Down to Earth that summer moong (green gram) and urad (black gram) formed the majority of summer crops.

He added that since the temperature had exceeded 40°C since the first week of April and continued to be dry, it will make a difference in the pollination of these pulse crops. Also, pulses will not be able to form beans due to the heat.

Aditya Pratap said farmers who had harvested potatoes and mustard in the middle of February and had planted summer crops in the last week of February or the first week of March, won’t suffer much.

But farmers who had harvested wheat and had planted pulses in the middle or last week of March after harvesting it, may witness damage to their crop.

Procurement worries

Summer crops are considered as a source of additional income for farmers, as they are planted in the remaining season between Rabi and Kharif. The Indian government aims to reduce the import of pulses and oilseeds by promoting summer crops since these form the bulk of such crops.

The Union government is appealing to the states to motivate farmers to plant more summer crops. However, states complain that the central government is not taking any concrete step regarding the procurement of these crops.

This year, summer crops have been planted on 5.58 million hectares, according to the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare. This is slightly less than the 5.64 million hectares on which they were planted last year. The area under summer crops in 2018-19 was 3.36 million hectares.

This issue was raised at the National Agriculture Conference for the Zaid Summer Campaign 2022 organised by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare in January at Delhi.

The procurement issue was raised by the additional chief secretary, agriculture department, Government of Madhya Pradesh. He said Madhya Pradesh produced 1.2 million tonnes of moong in the summer of 2021. The state has planted crops on 0.8 million hectares.

But the central government allowed only 0.25 million tonnes to be procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund.

The financial pressure on the state government increased due to this. It could not encourage its farmers. It had to consequently spend Rs 200-300 crore on the disposal of the produce.

However, the secretary assured the delegates that the central government would procure 25 per cent of the total production of summer crops from now on.

But for this, state governments will have to give timely information about the increase in the total sown area of summer crops starting from this year, so that the permission for purchase can be given in advance.

The Directorate of Economics and Statistics that functions under the Union Ministry of Agriculture, has also been asked to keep an eye on the figures from time to time.

Increase in crops

During the conference, officials from Bihar said summer crops had been sown on 1.1 million hectares in the state, in which the share of pulses and oilseeds was about 0.8 million hectares. Of this, pulses were sown on 0.52 million hectares.

Bihar has said it will increase the area under cultivation of summer crops and this will include sunflower, urad, moong, hybrid maize and summer rice. Jharkhand will also sow summer crops on 80,000 hectares. Summer rice and summer moong will be prominent among them.

Odisha has said it will sow summer crops on 0.62 million hectares in 2022, as against the target of 0.59 million hectares achieved in 2019.

Odisha said it had no complaints about summer crops. But it demanded that the loss caused by wild animals should also be covered under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.

Odisha also noted that no assistance was being given to the state by the central government under the National Food Security Mission.

Haryana assured that the yield of summer moong would be increased thrice and that of sunflower would be increased by 25 per cent. Maharashtra had sown summer crops on about 0.1 million hectares in 2020-21.

Andhra Pradesh said it had good potential to produce summer crops due to the moisture in its soil owing to the winter rains. This is the reason why the state has prepared a special strategy for sowing of black gram, green gram and groundnut.

Karnataka has also set a target of sowing summer crops on 0.5 million hectares. Kerala said paddy was sown in the state during the summer season, although the state government is trying to sow millet under the Crop Diversification Scheme.",0
798780,"Excess rainfall in Nov-Dec, early heat: Why lime production was hit in Andhra, India's largest producer","Gujarat, Maharashtra also affected, prices to come down in a fortnight, say experts

Lime prices may be burning holes in middle-class pockets, but has that translated into super profits for farmers? Cultivators in Andhra Pradesh, the largest supplier of the citrus, are not exactly a happy lot.

Their experience is another case study of how extreme weather can add to farm worries.

Lime is cultivated in the state over an area of 41,858 hectares, of which 18,797 hectares fall in the erstwhile SPSR Nellore district (before its recent reorganisation), said K Srinivasulu, deputy director, state horticulture department.

The state is also home to Asia’s biggest lime market yard in Gudur town, Tirupati district.

Fall in production

Excess rainfall in Nellore district hampered lime flowering. For good flowering in lime trees farmers don’t water them in September and October — a treatment called bahar.

It is a part of management practice to get flowering in December, said L Srinivas Rao, district horticulture officer, Nellore. “It takes three-four months for flowers to become a fruit. Extended rainfall upto December and January delayed flowering, causing delay in production.”

Flowering was not affected in trees on gravel soil which does not retain moisture, he added.

The rains hit all the major lime-growing districts of Nellore and West Godavari districts, which have major markets for the citrus fruit.

A Venkata Ramanaiah Naidu, vice-president, Federation of Farmers Associations, SPSR Nellore district, said:

The crop this year would be just 20 per cent of the normal yield. A farmer who produced 10 bags of the fruit is currently managing just one bag. The excessive rain and floods from the Somasila project and pests played spoilsport. The rain led to even death of trees due to excess water. Most horticulture crops, including mango, have been affected by the rains leading to less production. Early heat is also affecting flowering.

Lack of proper prices in the last seven to eight years for lime had led to farmers not taking up its cultivation, Naidu added.

Even now, as the yield has fallen, the gains to farmers would not be high. “Nearly 60-70 per cent of the crop goes out of state.”

The assertions are vouched for by K Nagarathnaiah and M Anji Reddy, farmers with lime plantations in Pallakonda village, Kaluvoya mandal of Nellore.

“As the land was moist with rains from October to January 15, it was not suitable for management practices like adding organic manures and pruning trees,” said B Pratap, senior scientist at the Citrus Research Station in Petlur in Nellore district.

Many trees were removed during the drought in 2017-18 so that must have affected production to an extent, he added. “Trees which are just 4-5 years old cannot give the yield of 10-year-old trees. In one or two years there will be glut again leading to fall in prices.”

The farmers lost interest in going for new plantation last year as they faced losses due to COVID-19-induced situations, the expert said. “The interest will increase now.

Arrival at market yards

The fall in production is evidenced by the drastic reduction in arrival of produce at Gudur, Eluru and Nakirekal markets in Nalgonda district of Telangana. Around 10-15 vehicles carrying 25 tonnes of lime each are arriving in Gudur currently. Normally, the yard sees the arrival of 40-50 vehicles, said A Mastan Naidu, a mandi owner in the yard.

The condition in Eluru market yard is no better, said MNV Prabhakar, market secretary of the yard. Arrivals are just seven-eight lorries from the normal 20 lorries.

Andhra Pradesh has had the highest production of lime crop in the country for the last 30-40 years, said U Chakrapani, president, South India Lemon Exporters Association, (a grouping with 15 markets across AP, Telangana and Karnataka who send the crop to North India).

Lime season in Maharashtra and Gujarat is completed by summer as the climate is hotter there. The cold climate in the north is not suitable for flowering in lime during October, November and December. So, they cannot provide sufficient lime during summer for their needs and rely on us.

Crops will start arriving at markets in Gujarat and Maharashtra after May 15-20, said Chakrapani. The shortfall of crops in these states is due to incessant rainfall in the months of November, December and January. The crop was damaged more in the West Godavari district than Nellore, leading to less flowering here, he added.

The festival month of Ramzan has also led to increased demand, said CH Jagan, president of Nakirekal market yard in Nalgonda district of Telangana. “Just five lorries of 15-20 tonnes are currently arriving here, while normally there are 20-25 lorries,” he said.

Gudur, Eluru markets along with Nakirekal and Bijapur markets account for around 90 per cent of the lime sent to north India, Jagan said, adding that prices will reduce in the next 10-15 days.",1
798821,Extreme weather: Over 5 million hectares of crop lost due to rain in 2021,"Karnataka worst-hit, followed by Rajasthan, West Bengal, Bihar and Maharashtra

Over 5 million hectares of agricultural area was affected due to heavy rains during 2021, according to a written reply in the Lok Sabha by Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar on November 30.

The 50.4 lakh hectare area was affected due to cyclonic storm / flash floods / floods / landslides / cloudburst and others as on November 25, 2021, was from a total of 20 states.

Karnataka was the worst hit, with crop loss on 1.4 million ha area, followed by Rajasthan (679,000 ha), West Bengal (690,000 ha), Bihar (580,000 ha), Maharashtra (455,000 ha). Other states included Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha among others, according to the minister.

Rains have wreaked havoc on almost all of these states, which received either ‘large excess’ or ‘excess’ rainfall this year.

Karnataka, which has the highest area under crop damage, for example, received 102 per cent excess rainfall from October-November, according to data by the Indian Meteorological Department.

Out of the Rs 23,186.4 crore allocated under State Disaster Response Fund, for providing necessary relief measures in the wake of natural calamities, Rs 17,747.2 crore has been released in two instalments till now, Tomar stated. The highest release of funds was to Maharashtra (Rs 2,577.6 crore), and Uttar Pradesh (Rs 1,546.40 crore).

“The Indian Council of Agricultural Research under network project ‘National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture’ conducts strategic research, technology demonstration and capacity building to address impact of climate change on agriculture and agro-based commodities,” he said, adding:

In the absence of any adaptation measures, yields of rainfed and irrigated rice, wheat and kharif maize are likely to be reduced under projected climate change scenarios, the minister said in response to another question related to the impact of climate change on agriculture.

The Government under the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture, one of the eight missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), is addressing the risk associated with climate change by devising appropriate adaptation and mitigation strategies, ensuring food security in the country, Tomar said.

To support the objectives of NAPCC, 33 states and union territories have already prepared their State Action Plan on Climate Change to address state specific actions, the reply said.",1

Farmer leaders in Anantapuramu district of Andhra Pradesh undertook a month-long padayatra (march) of 780 kilometres, covering 170 villages November 20, 2021 to demand compensation for their crops damaged in recent floods.

R Chandra Sekhar Reddy, district secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha told this reporter that proper remunerative rates should be ensured for the banana crop.

He also urged the administration to restore the subsidy for drip irrigation equipment, input subsidy for crops and CCRC (Crop Cultivators Rights Card) for all tenant farmers among other demands.”

The march started from Anantapuramu November 20 and will end December 18.

Andhra Pradesh has been witnessing unusually heavy rainfall for over a week now. At least 33 people have died in the floods caused due to the heavy rains, according to the media reports.

Farmers across the Rayalaseema region that this reporter spoke to, said they were in a dire situation due to the floods.

MB Ramudu, from Mukundapuram village in the Garladinne mandal of Ananthapuramu district said paddy, cotton and groundnut crops had been completely destroyed.

He said:

After we received rains in June, farmers sowed groundnut in July. But it did not rain properly until September. The latest rains have led to the rotting of the dry groundnut plants, denying even fodder for our cattle. They have to survive now only eating green grass as we are flush with water everywhere.

V Chennappa, a chilli farmer in Kanaganapalli village and mandal of Ananthapuramu district had cultivated chillies by leasing five acres of land and spending Rs 3 lakh.

He is worried about his crop as he has been told it would be hit by more diseases due to these rains.

“It’s been raining for seven days now and the groundnut crop in the mandal has been destroyed. The banana crop has survived as of now as the rains have not been accompanied by heavy winds,” Chennappa told this reporter.

GV Ramana Reddy, a farmer from Gundlurivaripalle of Sodam mandal of Chittoor district said the district received untimely rains in September.

That was the time when the nuts of the groundnut crop had to grow in their pods. Reddy said:

It has been raining continuously not allowing the land to dry since September. Dryness in the land is needed for the plant to produce more pods. The groundnut produce therefore fell from the expected 20 bags of 40 kgs each to just 4-5 bags, leaving me short of Rs 8,000 from my pocket having spent Rs 20,000 on the crop per acre.

Changing weather

Weather experts at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL) located in Gadanki, Chittoor district, said the changes in the climate of the Rayalaseema region had been visible since 2012.

Being a rain-shadow region, rains evade the Rayalaseema region during June and July, with occasional rainfall during these months.

The region receives more rains in the north east monsoon during October, November and December. This is true for both Rayalaseema and Tamil Nadu, Amit P Kesarkar, a scientist at the NARL, said.

He added that there was now a southward shift in the occurrence of the south west monsoon emanating from the Arabian Sea, leading to more rains for Rayalaseema and Tamil Nadu.

“Normally, the rains were not severe earlier. But the southward expansion of monsoonal flow has increased chances of rain for the region in the last decade,” Kesarkar said.

The weather phenomenon of La Nina is making the western Pacific Ocean warmer, leading to frequent easterly waves over the Indian Ocean, Kesarkar said.

“The low-pressure areas which develop inside easterly waves are a combination of regional weather as well as probably climate change. Depressions which are happening inside the easterly waves, are leading to more rains for south India as a whole,” he added.

GV Ramanjaneyulu, director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture in Hyderabad, said Andhra Pradesh will have to make changes in its cropping pattern to adapt to the changing situation.

“We will have to shift from paddy to millets, pulses and oil seeds which we are importing from other countries now. This is not the 1960s. We are not short of food grains now. Instead, we have a glut,” he said.

A change in the cropping pattern will help mitigate changes in climate in Andhra as paddy and sugarcane, both water-intensive crops, release greenhouse gases, Ramanjaneyulu said.

“We should cultivate paddy seeds which don’t germinate immediately after being soaked in water given the frequent storms,” he added.",1
798838,Heavy rains damage paddy crop in Bihar’s Seemanchal and Kosi regions,"Standing crops have been damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year

Unexpected heavy rainfall in October has ended the hopes of paddy farmers in northeastern Bihar’s Seemanchal and Kosi regions of getting a good crop this year.

Vinod Kumar, a scientist at the Araria Krishi Vigyan Kendra, told this reporter that heavy rains October 18 and 19, 2021 had damaged harvested paddy and also affected standing paddy.

“No one expected this. The rains have not only damaged paddy but will also delay cultivation of rabi crops such as potato due to waterlogging and moisture in fields,” Kumar said.

Satyendra Jha and Ravindar Yadav, who are marginal farmers of Araria district, were happy till last week as they expected a good paddy harvest either by the end of October or early next month.

But their hopes have been dashed after the heavy rains of the last 48 hours.

“Several farmers had harvested paddy and left it to dry in their fields. They would be hit hard. The rains have also damaged flowering paddy,” Yadav, a resident of a village under the Sikti block, said.

“The standing paddy is now submerged under rainwater and is unlikely to germinate as rains continue October 20. This will affect paddy output per hectare and quality as well,” Jha, a resident of a village near Forbesganj, said.

Pravin Kr Jha, Kishanganj district agriculture officer, said he has directed all block-level agriculture officials to survey and assess damage caused to paddy by heavy rains and submit a report soon.

“The magnitude of the damage will be known only after block agriculture officials submit their reports,” he added.

The state agriculture department had released the state’s official paddy production target of 118 lakh metric tonnes (MT) in August this year. The target last year was 90 lakh MT last year.

This year, paddy has been transplanted in nearly 72 per cent of the total 33 lakh hectares identified for production, as compared to 29.22 lakh hectares last year.

But last week, Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary in the state Cabinet, said repeated floods and surplus rains had damaged standing crops across thousands of hectares as farmland.

Read Bihar to give subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate crops due to waterlogging

Standing crops were damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year, according to the agriculture department’s assessment.

Farmers could not even sow in about 141,227 hectares this kharif season as large tracts of agricultural land remained under water due to excessive monsoon rainfall.

The state government for the first time earmarked Rs 100 crore in farm subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate on their land due to waterlogging.

Strange monsoon

This year, Bihar has received only three per cent surplus rainfall after the arrival of the monsoon on time. This is less than last year when the state received 25 per cent surplus rainfall from June to September.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal during July and August. But Bihar received surplus rainfall in June this year, just as the monsoon arrived. This resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.

Sanjay Kumar, weather scientist at the India Meteorological Department, Patna, said Bihar recorded surplus rainfall in June 2020 and 2021.

“This is the maximum rainfall the state has received in the last decade in June,” he said.

According to him, Bihar received 97.8 millimetres (mm) of rain in June 2019, nearly 40 per cent less than normal; 100.3 mm in 2018; 84.6 mm in 2017; 128.7 mm in 2016 and 123.6 mm in 2015.

After the monsoon had retreated from the region, Bihar has received 140.3 mm rainfall October 18-19, 2021, according to the India Meteorological Department. This was 157 per cent more the 54.7 mm the state usually receives at this time.

The rainfall was especially heavy in the Seemanchal and Kosi regions of the state.

Araria received 95 mm rainfall between October 18 and 19. Other places that received heavy showers included Kishanganj (67.45 mm), Katihar (66 mm), Khagaria (74.9 mm), Saharsa (74 mm), Supaul (50 mm) and Madhepura (45 mm).

The local meteorological office has forecast more rainfall in the coming two to three days.

Heavy rain in Bihar during October was unusual, according to weather experts. They did not rule out climate change as the cause.",1
798843,"Odisha: Excess September rainfall bridges seasonal deficit, won’t help Kharif yield","Floodwater from Baitarani and Salandi rivers have submerged acres of paddy

Odisha received large excess rainfall in September 2021. It has helped compensate for the state’s monsoon rainfall deficit will do nothing for Kharif crops, especially paddy.

The eastern state recorded 384.8 millimetres of rainfall in September 2021, its highest for the month in 14 years, induced by deep depressions over Bay of Bengal and Cyclone Gulab, according to Umashankar Das, senior scientist at the India Meteorological Department centre in Bhubaneswar. The normal precipitation for September is 226.6 mm, and the state had received 401.7 mm and 483.2 mm September rainfall in 2007 and 1961.

Odisha had recorded deficient rainfall in the preceding months of June (16.6 per cent), July (21.3 per cent) and August (44.7 per cent), according to sources. The excess rainfall in September made up for this deficit, said Das.

But the late, heavy rainfall will not translate into agricultural gains for the state, experts warned. “Good rainfall is required in July and August for germination and tilling. But the deficit in both those months have affected Kharif prospects,” said Amresh Khuntia, professor of agronomy, Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar.

As on September 25, the paddy coverage was 3.5 million hectares as compared to 3.7 million hectares in the corresponding period of 2020, official sources said.

At least six out of the Odisha’s 30 districts are still in the red at the end of September. Western Odisha districts like Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bolangir, Nabarangpur, Kalahandi and Jajpur have recorded marginal rain deficits of 20-29 per cent, Khuntia said.

He is one of the members of the Weather Watch Group of the state government, which reviews the crop situation in the state from time to time. He, along with agriculture officials, visited different areas of Bhadrak district October 4, 2021 to assess the impact of Cyclone Gulab that struck the east coast September 26.

Acres of paddy crop may have been submerged in Chandabali and Solagaon in Bhadrak due to the recent floods in river Baitarani and Salandi, he said. Moreover, around 224,000 hectares of paddy land in 10 were inundated following heavy rainfall on September 12-14, sources said.

‘Floodwater from Baitarani has completely submerged my two-acre land and is yet to recede. I fear the paddy crop will be destroyed,” said Maheswar Muni from Chandabali.

Amari Mallick from Thuamul-Rampur in Kalahandi district, on the other hand, said his paddy crop grown on five acres of land may not recover from the rainfall shortage in the previous months.

“Paddy yield in the state is likely to suffer this year due to late rains,” said Ashok Pradhan, a leader of Paschima Odisha Krushak Sangram Samanwaya Samiti, a major farmers’ organisation in western Odisha.

The government should declare drought-affected areas in the state and provide compensation to the farmers.",1

The monsoon in Bengal has seen phases of heavy rains as well as dry spells. Photo: @rickysohel / Twitter

The southwest monsoon this year has had a highly irregular trajectory. There were heavy rains in June in parts of India. After this, it stalled. There was extreme rainfall in some states. Now, it seems that the monsoon will withdraw a month late, like last year. All this has led to heavy losses being suffered by farmers in many states, including West Bengal.

Farmers who cultivate sesame and peanuts in Bengal have faced huge losses during May and June in Hooghly, Burdwan, Bankura and Paschim Medinipur districts.

Paddy cultivation has been ruined in a few areas of Paschim Medinipur and Hooghly. It is still under threat if there is heavy rain in the last leg of the monsoon as predicted by the India Meteorological Department.

Farmers who cultivate seasonal vegetables in many parts of southern Bengal have faced losses due to heavy rains during July, which has resulted in the hike of vegetable prices.

This reporter spoke to farmers in various parts of Bengal to find out how the change in the monsoon pattern had affected them.

Tales of woe

“We sowed paddy seedlings in the end of July. Then, there was heavy rain. Our whole area was completely waterlogged. I have more than nine bighas (Three acres) and I had invested approximately Rs 8,000 per bigha. All that has been lost,” Prasanta Jana, a sharecropper from Khanakul in Hooghly district, said.

Khanakul is one of the areas where heavy rains in July created havoc. The bigha is a traditional unit of land measurement in India, Bangladesh and Nepal. Its size varies from place to place.

Jana is now sowing paddy a second time. He is worried that he will be ruined again if it rains heavily for a second time.

He also cultivates peanuts during the summer. This year, five of his 10 bighas where he had sowed peanuts, were destroyed due to heavy rainfall. He had invested Rs 14,000 per bigha.

He cultivates potatoes in the winter but laments that he never gets proper prices for it. “We are not getting any financial support from the government despite being sharecroppers. Where will we go?” Jana sounds helpless.

Read: All in a day: Dry northern districts have excess rain after July 13 shower

Sharecroppers do not get any financial support from the state government as they cannot provide the documents which are needed to avail that. They thus have to bear the entire loss themselves.

The West Bengal government provides Rs 5,000 per annum (Rabi and Kharif seasons) assistance, with a minimum of Rs 2,000 per annum on a pro rata basis to farmers who have one or more acres of land under its Krishakbandhu scheme.

Registered farmers under the Krishakbandhu scheme have also not received any financial assistance from the government so far this year.

Vegetable farmers in southern Bengal were particularly hit after the heavy rains in July-end. Farmers of Amta, Udaynarayanpu, Uluberia in Howrah district have faced losses.

Sujay Manna, a vegetable and paddy farmer from Uluberia, Howrah, who has five bighas of land said he has lost almost all of his vegetables like ridge gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber, eggplant, etc which he usually cultivates during the monsoon.

He invested almost Rs 80,000-90,000 in the vegetable cultivation during this monsoon, which he has lost.

Farmers in districts like Bankura too have faced losses. Usually, rainfall is low or normal in Bankura. But this time, it has been heavy. Rajib Hansda, a farmer from Sarenga, Bankura said it started raining heavily in July-end after mostly medium rains in the beginning.

Hansda has three-four bighas of land where his family usually cultivates paddy.

When it started to rain heavily, water was released from dams into rivers and canals. At that time, Hansda did not preserve water. Now, it has not rained in the past few days. Consequently, his land is dry.

Other farmers in the area are also facing similar issues. They are looking forward to the administration opening canals to supply water to their lands.

Another district badly affected by floods is Paschim Medinipur. Liaqat Ali’s family has 10 bighas of agricultural land in Keshpur where he cultivates paddy.

The seedlings which he sowed in June-July have been ruined. He is now risking a second sowing. Ali said he himself had not received any seeds. But some of his fellow farmers had received two-four kilograms of seeds from the village administration.

“The money we receive from Krishakbandhu, Rs 5,000 in each installment, has helped us a bit,” he said. Ali lost Rs 24,980 till date in the first sowing.

“Now, I am borrowing this amount for the second time, a double investment in one season. The picture is the same in the entire district,” Ali said.

Souren Chatterjee from Burdwan, an organic farmer said farmers in some flood-prone parts of Burdwan now sow jute and some vegetables instead of paddy during the monsoon. They have thus avoided huge losses this time.",1
798864,"Deficient rainfall affects paddy, triggers drought fears in Odisha","As many as 19 districts have recorded large deficits of rainfall in August

Odisha’s paddy cultivation has been impacted due to rainfall deficit during the Kharif cultivation season, triggering fears of drought among farmers.

The southwest monsoon hit the eastern state early this year. But it also entered the ‘break’ phase sooner, leaving around 30 per cent deficient rainfall till August 15, 2021.

Paddy, the major kharif crop, is grown over 3.5 million hectares in Odisha. Till August 13 this year, the paddy coverage was only 2.46 million hectares due to low rainfall, according to local sources.

Cumulative rainfall (June 1 to August 15)

Yellow: Large deficient (-99 per cent to -60 per cent); Red: Deficient (-59 per cent to -20 per cent)

The normal rainfall from June 1 to August 15 is 749.5 millimetres (mm) across the state. This year, the state received an average precipitation of 524.8 mm during the period, according to the regional centre of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Bhubaneswar.

Large deficit in August

Rainfall was deficient in seven districts: Jajpur (54 per cent), Bhadrak (51 per cent), Bolangir (44 per cent), Jharsugurha (42 per cent), Kendrapara (41 per cent), Angul (40 per cent) and Gajapati (40 per cent). In six districts, the precipitation was excess or normal: Nuapada (18 per cent), Puri (19 per cent), Cuttack (17 per cent) Koraput (14 per cent), Malkangiri (15 per cent) and Jagatsinghpur (16 per cent), sources said.

There was a rainfall deficit of around 63 per cent in August, which brought down the precipitation average of the kharif months, said Uma Shankar Das, a scientist of regional centre of IMD, Bhubaneswar. All the 30 districts of the state received 68.5 mm rainfall cumulatively till August 15 against the normal of 187.2 mm, he added.

As many as 19 districts have recorded large deficits (above 60 per cent) of rainfall in August. Angul (88 per cent) recorded the highest deviation from normal, followed by Kandhamal (85 per cent), Bargada (83 per cent), Sambalpur (83 per cent), Sonepur (80 per cent), Boudh (79 per cent), Jharsuguda, Puri, Keoinjhar (78 per cent each), Bolangir, Deogarh (76 per cent each) and Nuapada (75 per cent).

The lack of a remarkable low pressure areas over Bay of Bengal after June 10 was behind the weak monsoon in Odisha, said Sarat Chandra Sahu, director, Center for Environment and Climate, Siksha ‘O’ Anusandhan, a deemed university.

This was the reason for the erratic pattern of the rainfall in the state, added Sahu, who is also the former director of the regional centre of IMD, Bhubaneswar.

Widespread rainfall is likely to occur in the state on August 16-18 under the influence of the cyclonic circulation, sources said. The rainfall, however, is unlikely to compensate for the August deficit due to its low intensity, said weather scientists.

Effect on agriculture

Usually, the Kharif activities start from May end and continue till August end. Farmers across the state worried over the perspective of the crop this year due to deficient rains.

Like every year, the farmers had started sowing in the first week of June after the rainfall, said Jaga Pradhan, a farmer in Chhendipada in Angul district. “But now, we are extremely worried because of the lull in the monsoon rainfall.”

The farmers had suffered immense crop loss during Cyclone Yaas in May this year and were hoping for a recovery this season. ‘The current monsoon trend will shatter our hope of bumper harvest of paddy this year,” said Bijay Behera from Chandabali in Bhadrak district.

There was no report of crop damage in the state despite a shortfall of paddy coverage due to scanty rainfall, officials of the state’s agriculture department said.

“The Kharif activities are going on till the end of August and we are hopeful the situation will improve this month,” said Amaresh Khuntia, professor of Agronomy, Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT), Bhubaneswar.

He advised to continue the agriculture activities through localised rains and canal water, by removing grass and other samplings from the fields. He also suggested diversification of the crops in the situation.

Irrigation system

The water resources department of Odisha has planned to provide irrigation facilities to around 27 lakh hectares of crops during this Kharif season from different sources. These include major, medium, minor, lift irrigation projects, deep bore-well and check dams.

But this will depend on the water level of the reservoirs and the monsoon rainfall trend, said a senior engineer.

Barring some major and minor irrigation projects, other projects can provide water for irrigation through the canal system. The water level of the reservoirs will be depleted and the situation may turn alarming if the dry spell continues some more days, he said.

The state has around 63 reservoirs, including 10 major ones, which can irrigate 4.3 million hectares, sources said.

In the Kharif season, the irrigation projects only supply around 50 per cent water needed for cultivation, while the other 50 per cent depend on the rain, said J Rath, former engineer-in chief, water resources department.

“We are monitoring the situation and are well prepared for any drought-like eventuality, state’s revenue minister Sudam Marandi said. Rainfall is still possible in the area this season, he added.",1
798868,Bihar farmers stare at huge loss of Kharif crops due to erratic monsoon rainfall,"Late transplantation of paddy crops may lead to crop yield loss of up to 50 per cent

An erratic monsoon has dented the hopes of Bihar’s farmers of a good Kharif 2021.

The rainfall was very heavy in parts of the state and scanty in others, because of which the cultivators have not been able to transplant paddy seedlings or sow maize seeds. Around 50 per cent of the farmlands was still unused till July 27, 2021, according to official records.

Kharif is the main crop of farmers in the state: It gives economic sustenance to thousands of families dependent on agriculture for survival.

The late transplantation of paddy crops caused by erratic rainfall may lead to crop yield loss of up to 50 per cent in the eastern state, agricultural experts estimated.

The ideal period for transplanting paddy seedlings is till mid-August but the progress has been slow this year due to rainfall deficiency in several parts of the state, they argued.

Only 46.88 per cent of the desired paddy transplantation has taken place so far and maize-sowing was 68.94 per cent in the state till last week, a report by the Bihar agriculture department showed. This happened due to rain deficiency in most of south, central and eastern Bihar and flooded fields in the northern region of the state as a result of heavy rains.

Of the total target of transplanting paddy crops in 3,300,000 hectares of land, just 15,46,958 hectares have been covered so far, the report said. Till July 22 last year, paddy transplantation had been completed in 2,284,680 hectares, according to the department data.

Similarly for maize, seeds have been sown over 310,214 hectares of land against a target of 4,50,000 hectares. Till this time last year, maize seeds were sown in 372,589 hectares of land, the report said.

“Late transplantation of paddy seedlings may cause at least 50 per cent yield loss to Bihar,” agriculture expert Hari Mohan Mishra said, adding the crop yields depend on the duration of crops. “The more the duration, the higher the crop yields.” He added:

If the yield of a 150-160-day variety crop is 55-60 quintals per hectare, then a 100 days variety has only 25-30 quintals. However better the crop management, the yield won’t go up much since the formation of paddy tillers (leaves) remains small due to shorter duration.

There are at least seven districts of the state's total 38 where paddy plantation has been less than 20 per cent till July 22 because Bihar reported about 26 per cent rainfall deficiency in the current month, according to data from the agriculture department.

Of the seven districts, two eastern Bihar districts of Munger and Jamui have reported little over two per cent paddy transplantation. Similarly, paddy transplantation coverage is only seven per cent in Sheikhpura, 13 per cent in Gaya, 16.82 per cent in Aurangabad and 17 per cent in Banka, 21.19 per cent in Nalanda (the home district of the state’s chief minister Nitish Kumar), 23.36 per cent in Bhagalapur, 25 per cent in Purnia, 30.07 per cent in Bhojpur, 30.44 per cent in Khagaria, 33.87 per cent in Patna and 37.81 per cent in Begusarai districts.

“The rainfall deficit is more than 250 per cent in Jamui and the day temperature is still around 32 degrees Celsius,” district agriculture officer of Jamui, Avinash Chandra said. The prevailing situation predicts a very bleak future for paddy crops, he added.

Large parts of farmlands have dried up due to low precipitation. So, even if some farmers managed to transplant the seedlings in their fields using pump sets, the plants have started withering away for want of adequate irrigation facilities.

Munger, an eastern district, is facing such a situation. “The fields have dried up and cracks have surfaced. Plants are withering on the field. If we get no rainfall soon, our remaining paddy seedlings will also get destroyed,” said Naresh Murmu, a local farmer. He has three acres of agricultural land but was able to complete paddy transplantation on just half an acre so far.

Farmers in the southern district of Nawada found themselves in a more precarious position. The district received 347 mm above-average rainfall in June which delayed sowing of paddy seeds, said officials. And now that it is time for transplantation, the monsoons have given the area a miss.

“The paddy transplantation has been badly hit due to erratic rainfall. We expect crop damage of up to 30 per cent,” Nawada district agriculture officer Laxman Prasad said.

There was a rain deficit of 47 per cent in Banka district and this affected paddy transplantation. “Paddy seedlings are safe in the fields but the transplantation has been delayed due to dry fields. The farmers may suffer a huge crop loss if they carry out transplantation after August 15,” said district agriculture officer, Banka, Vishnudeo Kumar Ranjan.

In the north Bihar districts, paddy transplantation works were affected due to flooded fields. The areas criss-crossed by a number of major rivers such as Kosi, Bagmati, Kamala Balan, Gandak and Ghaghra got early rainfall and then, in July, faced flash floods. This not only delayed sowing of seeds but also flooded the paddy-transplanted fields.

The farmers who lost their paddy seedlings due to water-logged fields are now planning to sow paddy seeds again to make up for the loss.

“We face such situations almost every year and hence, save some seeds for the worst time. We are now planning to sow paddy seeds in fields where transplanted paddy seedlings have been destroyed. We know we will suffer yield loss but at least our farmland won’t remain unused,” said Manoj Kumar, a farmer from Motihari in East Champaran district. He added:

Farmers whose fields are not inundated will have a loss of up to 30 per cent but those with farmland still under water will suffer 100 per cent loss.

Around 75 per cent of the state's population is dependent on agriculture, according to Bihar Economic Survey, 2020-21.",1
798873,Kharif farming affected as monsoon plays truant in Odisha,"The state received around 17 per cent deficit rainfall in June 2021

Farming during the current Kharif season has been affected in most parts of Odisha as the monsoon played a truant: The state received around 17 per cent deficit rainfall in June 2021.

The state received an average 181.3 millimetres rainfall against its normal of 210.7 mm, said HR Biswas, director, regional centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Bhubaneswar.

South-west monsoon was set arrive in the state June 10, a day ahead of its time last year, with widespread rainfall. Deficient rainfall in June — crucial for paddy sowing and transplantation of Kharif crops — is likely to affect farming activities, said Surendra Nath Pasupalak, former vice-chancellor, Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar.

As many as 14 districts, including Bhadrak, Gajapati and Ganjam, recorded deficit rainfall; 16 recorded normal or a little above normal rainfall.

Puri, Koraput, Kendrapara and Cuttack recorded excess rainfall in June, according to sources.

Pasupalak added deficient rainfall was recorded in as many as 152 out of 314 blocks, mostly in the southern part of the state. The situation could be worse if there is no rainfall in the next 10 days, he said.

The farmers have to go for medium- and short-duration paddy variety for cultivation, said Pasupalak.

Odisha has proposed to cultivate paddy in around 35 lakh hectares during this Kharif season, as against the 36.5 lakh hectares last year, official sources said.

Farming activities for Kharif season usually start off in the third week of June with the arrival of monsoon. But this year has been different, said Sudhir Rout, a leading farmer in Kukudakhandi block in Ganjam district.

“We are waiting for July rainfall to start transplantation of paddy,” said Pitambar Karjee of Mohana in Gajapati district.

The situation is likely to improve in July in Ganjam district; the India Meteorological Department has predicts rainfall in the first week of July for the district, said Duryodhan Patang, chief district agriculture officer, Ganjam.

Meanwhile, the regional centre of the IMD, Bhubaneswar, has predicted that the state will experience heavy rainfall in the beginning of July. It issued yellow warnings in as many as 22 districts.

Heavy showers will lash few places in Koraput, Malkangiri, Deogarh, Sambalpur, Sundergarh, Dhenkanal, Angul and Cuttack in the next 24 hours, it stated.",1
798881,Cyclone Yaas aftermath: Odisha farmers in a fix over sowing Kharif crop,"At least 5,882 hectares of cultivable lands in five blocks of Balasore district affected by sea water

The aftermath of Cyclone Yaas continues to ring through Odisha a month after it struck the state: At least 5,882 hectares of cultivable land in five blocks of Balasore district has been affected by sea water; around 1,400 ha farmland has been hit in three blocks in Bhadrak district, sources said.

Among the worst affected is Chaka Sarth village in Balasore: All the standing crop as well as 217 hectares of fertile land there is damaged. The farm lands across the state are still inundated with saline water that entered the villages as rain water breached embankments.

As many as 300 farmers from the village are in a fix on whether to start cultivating Kharif crop on the inundated lands. Even if the water recedes, the land may not be fit to grow the Kharif crop due to heavy salt deposits, farmers said.

Chaka Sarth is not the only affected village. Large tracts of fertile land in two other districts have turned into saline soak land. The farmers affected in Odisha lamented their only source of livelihood was threatened.

“I harvested bumper paddy from my one hectare of land in 2020. I am now worried over how to use the same land for cultivation,” said Pramod Majhi, Chaka Sarth.

The Odisha government has entrusted the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar, and National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack, with examining the salinity in farm lands and suggest suitable crops in the areas.

Scientists at these two institutes had visited the affected areas in the first week of June. They picked soil samples from multiple to examine the salt-resistance crops that can be cultivated in those areas, said Bhadrak Jagannath Nanda, chief district agriculture officer.

“The breach of embankments caused damage to paddy fields. Farmers are now waiting for the rains that can minimise the impact of salt on the land. The rainwater can drain out the salinity,” said District Agriculture Officer, of Balasore, Prasad Kumar Nayak.

Cyclone Yaas hit the Odisha coast between Balasore and Bhadrak district. The storm caused very heavy rainfall in Balasore, Bhadrak, Mayurbhanj, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapara districts, affecting over six million people across 11,000 villages.

Odisha government pegged the initial losses at Rs 610 crore, sources said. Meanwhile, the Odisha government announced financial assistance of Rs 750 per hectare for the farmers in Balasore and Bhadrak. Assistance will be provided for a total of 10,000 hectares of land, sources said.

The assistance package of the state government to the Yaas hit farmers also included Rs 6,800 input subsidy per hectare to small and nominal farmers, with 33 per cent or above damage in non-irrigated land.

In irrigated areas, input subsidies of Rs 13,500 per hectare and Rs 18,000 per hectare for all types of daily crops. Mango, cashew, coconut, betel, kewda and other crops are included in the daily crop category.

Farmers will get a minimum subsidy of Rs 2,000 for daily crops and of Rs 1,000 for other crops.",1
798882,COVID-19 and Cyclone Yaas: Double whammy for Jharkhand’s watermelon farmers,"Unseasonal rainfall triggered by Cyclone Yaas, combined with COVID-19 restrictions, has led to few takers for the crop

There are few takers for watermelons and fruits are rotting in the field, several farmers complained. Photo: Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the ensuing lockdown had already hit hard; now, adverse weather due to Cyclone Yaas in May has made it a double whammy for watermelon farmers in Jharkhand.

There are few takers and fruits are now rotting in the field, several farmers complained. Debts are mounting and a lack liquid cash has cast a shadow on Kharif sowing even as monsoon has arrived.

Binita Devi was ready to harvest watermelons on her 2.4-hectare leased land when heavy rainfall lashed Murhu village in Khunti district in May-end. Some of the crop got damaged instantly, but most of it could be sold.

The private traders who would usually come to the fields to buy the crop did not visit the village for days, which led to the rotting of the crop.

“The traders didn’t come for days due to the lockdown and when they did, they offered to give only Rs 1-2 a kilogram as against the usual Rs 10-15 a kg. I refused to sell at such a low rate,” she said.

She added that the crop started getting damaged soon after, rather faster because of the unseasonal rainfall.

Parts of Jharkhand were battered by heavy rains because of the cyclone; capital Ranchi broke all previous records of rainfall during May.

A lack of village-level primary mandis (where farmers can sell their produce) prompts farmers to rely on private traders, who purchase the crop and sell it in markets, or export it to other states such as West Bengal and Odisha.

They don’t go to the market as the cost of transport would negate any profit they would make.

Lockdown restrictions in the state were eased on June 15, but Devi and her husband had already disposed of the fruit. They are now under a debt of Rs 2 lakh, out of which they took Rs 1.5 lakh on loan from ‘Mahila Mandal’ (self-help group) as well as from a bank in the village this year. They owe the bank Rs 50,000 from 2020.

“I sowed the watermelon crop on more land this time, thinking a bumper crop will help me pay back the entire amount. But I couldn’t make a penny,” she said.

She added that she owes Rs 7,000 lease amount to the landowner. The total cost of production this time is Rs 1.5 lakh.

Devi and her husband used to work as agricultural / daily wage labourers till three years ago, following which they started leasing out land for farming. They started with vegetables, but shifted to watermelon soon in hope of better returns.

Watermelon farming has grown substantially in the last five years. Currently, about 600-800 hectares of land is cultivated under watermelon in Ranchi alone.

Since farmers earned a good profit on the watermelon produce, it is cultivated in the other districts on a similar scale. During the last lockdown, many farmers were given permits. Railway also helped in transporting it to other states.

In 2021, however, farmers received help quite late, said Ashok Sinha, director, Directorate of Agriculture, Jharkhand.

Ishwar Mahli, a farmer from Lohardaga district, does not have any money to sow the Kharif crop: “Monsoon is here but I have no money left to even buy seeds.” He spent over Rs one lakh to produce the crop.

Mahli said:

“This is the first time ever in the last 10 years that I couldn’t sell even a single piece. This crop would have sold well if there were no lockdown. A trader came to buy the crop but offered only Rs 1 per kg. I refused and he didn’t come again. I then contacted a transport guy to take my crop to the market. He demanded Rs 3,000 and I asked him to come the next day. He did not turn up either.”

The nearest market is around 15 km away and farmers couldn’t access it due to lockdown.

Towards May-end, state agriculture minister Badal Patralekh took cognisance of the issue and asked district officials to look into the problem. The help announced, however, hasn’t reached most of the farmers yet.

“The government has opened service centres for farmers looking to sell watermelons. This did help a few farmers, but the number is limited. It also promised compensation for the damages caused by the cyclone. I have filled out the form, but don’t know whether I will get it or not. I usually invest Rs 20,000 on the crop and earn at least Rs 50,000. But in the last two years, I have just incurred losses and debt,” said Lakshman, a farmer.

“Small pieces (weighing up to two kg) and big ones (weighing upto five kg) are being sold at Rs 5 and Rs 10 respectively. We usually have 20-25 traders ready to buy produce, but right now we are hardly in touch with 10 traders,” said Aparn Uprao, who runs a non-profit.

Siraj Dutta of the Jharkhand Janadhikar Mahasabha said, “This situation again calls for the urgent need to fix minimum support price for all crops. The central and state government should compensate the farmers for their losses.”

He added that the Jharkhand government should ensure the selling of all crops at remunerative prices and also ensure no restrictions are placed during the lockdown for the transport and sale of the crops.",1
798884,Cyclone Yaas: Acres of standing crop destroyed in Odisha’s ‘vegetable bowl’,"Farmers fear further losses if rainwater is not flushed out from the fields

Cyclone Yaas that made landfal in Odisha May 26, 2021, damaged large tracts of crops, affecting betel–vine farmers, paddy farmers and vegetable growers in Kendrapara, Balasore, Mayurbhanj and Bhadrak districts.

The unseasonal torrential rain and ferocious winds brought by Cyclone Yaas severely damaged large tracks of vegetables, black and green gram, groundnut and summer paddy crops across the districts.

“I lost all the groundnuts on my three-acre land. How will I repay the bank loan?” said Samarendra Barik from Gobindapur village, Kendrapara.

Millions of green betel leaves that is used to make paan have been ruined by the heavy rains and gusty winds, said Narendra Jena, a betel farmer from Dagara village, Balasore district. “This will impact around thirty thousand betel-vine farmers in the four districts.”

Around 150 villages were submerged by floods after Cyclone Yaas struck. The affected villages form the ‘vegetable bowl’ of Odisha as the riverside land in the villages are very fertile, said Ramachandra Pradhan, a vegetable grower of Rajkanika village.

Many farmers like him whose crops were ruined will require financial help from the government to bounce back, he added. “Cyclone Yaas has broken our backbone.”

The increase in groundwater might have destroyed vegetables that were sown early, farmers fear. “Brinjal, pointed gourd and other crops may also get diseased due to the untimely rain,” said Bijaya Behera, a vegetable cultivator from Chandabali village in Bhadrak district.

The crop loss has already triggered a price hike of vegetables that had become cheaper last month due to good weather, he added.

Ramaniranjan Routray, a farmer leader associated with All India Krishak Sabha, said:

The cyclone and floods have already washed away standing crops. A large numbers of farmers fear more losses if rainwater is not flushed out from their lands within a week.

The state government faced losses amounting to Rs 610 crores due to Cyclone Yaas, said Suresh Chandra Mohapatra, chief secretary, Government of Odisha.

Hundreds of farmers will bear the impact of crop loss and many might find it hard to recover. “Immediate steps will be taken to arrange and distribute quality certified seeds in sufficient quantities to the affected farmers,” added Mohapatra.

An inter-ministerial central team conducted a spot assessment June 7 of damages caused by cyclone ‘Yaas’ and flooding in the affected areas.",1
798895,‘Unfavourable weather’ adds to worries of Bihar’s litchi farmers recovering from 2020 losses,"High temperatures throughout March and heatwaves and hailstorms predicted for April and May might hit yield

In Rameshwar Singh’s three-acre litchi orchard in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur, only half the trees have blossomed this year. The rest have just sprouted new leaves. The farmer, who is staring at losses, blamed the heavy water-logging after the surplus monsoon in 2020, followed by irregularities in this year’s weather for the poor flowering.

Singh, like thousands of litchi farmers in the district known as the ‘land of litchis’, was expecting a bumper harvest this year to make up for losses incurred last year due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic restrictions.

But high temperatures throughout March and heatwaves and hailstorms predicted for April and May has them worried about the quantity and quality of yield.

The fruit is harvested in May-June. The ideal pre-harvesting temperature for good fruit growth is 33-35°C, and should not be above 38°C, the farmers and experts said. This threshold was breached by the end of March.

At present, the maximum temperature is hovering around 34-36°C and minimum around 19-21°C, said Abdus Sattar, an agro-meteorologist at Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Pusa in Samastipur district.

With the early advent of warmer days, volume of production will certainly reduce this time, said Bachcha Singh, a litchi farmer and member of farmers’ union Litchi Utpadak Sangh.

“We are helpless as weather is not favourable for litchi farmers. Nothing is in our hands, what can we do?” said Mungeswar Rai, another local litchi cultivator.

The area received 110 centimetres of rainfall from June through mid-October, a rarity according to meteorologists.

This excess precipitation and resulting waterlogging has hit blossoming this year, admitted S D Pandey, director of National Research Centre on Litchi (NRCL) in Muzaffarpur.

Several orchards in low-lying areas remained waterlogged till December 2020 after heavy rainfall till October. Now the real challenge will be hot weather in the coming days as it will affect quality and size of fruit and increase dropping, he added.

The easterly winds may aggravate the problem by causing early fruit drop, said Vishal Nath, former director of NRCL.

There is a silver lining. Fruit-bearing trees can be watered adequately from April first week till second week of May to help the fruits grow to a good size and get the desirable colour, flavor and taste before harvest, said Pandey.

Also, at present, the night temperature is quite low, which is conducive for fruit growth, Nath said.

Litchi orchards are spread over nearly 12,000 hectares in Muzaffarpur district, which along with some of the nieghbouring districts, accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the country’s litchi production.

Last year, with lockdowns extending till June, the litchi farmers faced heavy financial losses.

The ongoing second wave of COVID-19 across the country has made them apprehensive as traders from other states are not coming to purchase the fruits or showing much interest to finalise deals online.",0
799022,Climate change and agriculture: Way ahead for low-emission growth,"Agriculture and livestock account for 18 per cent of gross national greenhouse gas emissions

A large number of festivals in India coincide with the harvest season. Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Baisakhi, Bihu, Nuakhai or Gudi Padwa — all commemorate the end of the agricultural season. People celebrate a successful harvest and pray for the prosperity and well-being of their families and community.

Suraj Munda, a farmer in Dumka district of Jharkhand, recollected his childhood memories when his family and village would celebrate Sohrai, a harvest festival that coincides with Diwali. Suraj and his fellow villagers grow rice in the kharif season. They sow the crop around the onset of monsoon in early to mid-June, and harvest it in mid-November.

However, changing rainfall patters in the form of delayed onse has meant that Suraj has to delay the sowing of paddy. Then there are times when a standing crop is present till as long as Diwali / Sohrai — something that was unheard of till 20-30 years ago.

Monsoon, in the last five years, has been delayed by 10-15 days in the state. The state has reported around 20-30 per cent rainfall deficit in the last few years.

This has impacted the cropping cycle and farm operations. These trends indicate a change in climatic patterns and are being increasingly felt not only in Jharkhand, but across several states.

Agriculture and climate change

It is well-established that climate change is aided by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. India is the third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases after China and the United States.

India emitted 2,299 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in 2018, according to a report by the International Energy Agency. This accounts for 7 per cent of global GHG emissions. Agriculture and livestock account for 18 per cent of gross national emissions.

A majority of agricultural GHG emissions occur at the primary production stage and are generated through the production and use of agricultural inputs (mainly water, fertilisers, and pesticides) farm machinery, soil disturbance, residue management and irrigation.

While the agriculture sector is responsible for climate change due to GHG emissions, it is also severely impacted by the effects of changing climate. Climate change is threatening India’s agricultural growth with frequent dry spells, heat waves and erratic rainfall.

With increasing population and the need to enhance food production, one has to address the challenge of meeting the growing demand for food production while controlling and reducing the GHG emissions from agriculture.

A study by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) pointed out that India has the potential to cut 18 per cent of its annual greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and livestock sector. The study estimated that 50 per cent of this reduction could be achieved by implementing these three measures: Efficient use of fertiliser, adoption of zero-tillage and management of water used to irrigate paddy.

“Moving our current agricultural production systems from an input-intensive regime to low external input system requires engaging with farmers to first demonstrate alternate practices and then convincing them to change their practices,” Niraj Kumar, chief functionary of Sathee, an organisation working to promote sustainable production practices among tribal communities of Jharkhand.

Concepts such as Low External Input Sustainable Agriculture (LEISA), which seek to optimise the use of locally available resources replacing external inputs is receiving increased attention as a sustainable alternative to chemical farming.

The Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) concept introduced in Andhra Pradesh in 2015 is a low-input, climate-resilient type of farming that encourages farmers to use low-cost locally sourced inputs. It eliminates the use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides.

In both these approaches, the focus is on promoting the usage of natural concoctions, inoculums and decoctions prepared with cow dung, cow urine, jaggery, lilac, green chillies, and other natural ingredients.

Cotton farmers in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal district are making the shift to a package of practices that lower the use of water (through in-situ soil moisture conservation and other demand management measures), promote the use of bio-fertilisers and bio-pesticides as a means to reduce the cost of cultivation and lower the environmental footprint of cotton cultivation.

Country-Director, Institute for Sustainable Communities, Vivek Adhia, said: “Our effort is to engage with small and marginal cotton farmers to train them on alternate package of practices, demonstrate the effectives of these and work in collaboration with the Krishi Vigyan Kendras to increase the outreach.”

One has to be mindful of the socio-economic and behavioural challenges associated with increasing adoption of alternate package of practices. A combination of tools and techniques covering capacity building, field demonstration, extension and outreach will enable faster adoption.

One would need a robust extension and knowledge sharing system in partnerships with the agriculture department, Krishi Vigyan Kendras, Agriculture Universities, Research Institutions to scale the adoption of sustainable farm practices. We would also need to provide better market linkages so that farmers are able to get assured and higher returns for their produce.

As we celebrated another International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer on September 16, we are faced with the harsh realities of changing climate and how it has impacted the well-being of humankind.

From the powerful economies to the less-developed countries; from countries in Europe and Americas to island nations in the Pacific, the impacts of climate change are real and here to stay.

Our efforts to combat climate change will have to focus on mitigation and adaption efforts across all sectors. For agrarian countries, the task will be to ensure increased production without increasing the environmental footprint of agriculture by enhancing the knowledge and skills of our farmers.",1
799037,COVID-19 and Cyclone Amphan: Betel vine farmers struck by double blow,"West Bengal’s Purba Medinipur district was the worst hit

The betel farmers of West Bengal were reeling financial distress propelled by the nationwide novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown, when super cyclone Amphan struck and made matters worse for them.

West Bengal’s Purba Medinipur district is well-known for betel plantation, a highly specialised commercial cropping activity. Betel farmers put in considerable efforts to adopt a suitable layout as well as financial resources, for betel plants are sensitive to soil and climatic conditions. The tropical plant requires proper maintenance of soil moisture, of soil aeration as well as sufficient humidity.

These betel vine farmers faced huge financial losses during the lockdown period due to lack of demand in the market. Though the state government allowed them to access the market in April, the move did not prove to be of much help.

“It is not possible to export products these days and traders are not buying betel leaves from farmers. The stock is piling on but the price is falling. It used to fetch us Rs 2,000 — these days we get only Rs 200-300,” said Ganesh Khatua (58), a farmer from Purba Medinipur district.

He added if the situation continued for the next two months, 50 per cent of vines will not survive. Due to lack of demand, many farmers had to destroy their produce, he claimed.

Several farmers had invested a big amount for the quarterly maintenance of the betel vine in February-March, 2020, with the hope of earning it back during summer.

Ekadashi Bhuiya (50), a betel vine farmer in Ramnagar block of Purba Medinipur, said, “I have already spent Rs 20,000 for maintenance of betel vine in February. I don’t know how I will make up for the loss”.

With the ease in lockdown restrictions during phase 4.0, many farmers hoped to sell the betel leaves in the market to repay loans taken for the maintenance of the betel vine. However, Cyclone Amphan smashed all hopes.

Betel vines of the coastal districts were hit hard by the tropical cyclone. The strong winds battered thousands of betel vines. Villagers in blocks such as Ramnagar, Saheed Matangini, Nanda Kumar, Tamluk of Purba Medinipur District are heavily dependent on betel plantation.

But the betel vine farmers are not the only ones on the receiving end. Cyclone Amphan also destroyed a thousand hectares of cropland of the district.

Around 70 per cent population of Purba Medinipur is dependent on subsistence agriculture. The district essentially gets a majority of its rice production during the winter season (rabi crop) from a particular variety of paddy called ‘Taichung’.

On the other hand, cultivation of the Amon paddy during monsoon season is quite uncertain owing to excessive rainfall, submergence of agricultural field and very poor drainage facilities, especially in the coastal blocks.

The harvesting of rabi crop was delayed in 2020 as West Bengal experienced continuous rain during the pre-monsoon period. Bhuiya said: “Many Boro farmers could not harvest their paddy due to continuous downpour during the harvest season. Farmers were harassed. The paddy field was full of water and we could not harvest the crop.”

Many farmers could not harvest the crop, and those who could, could not stock it properly.

A report stated that in Purba Medinipur alone, around 30,000 ha of paddy crop; 12,000 ha of Sesame and 5,000 ha of vegetable land was lost to Cyclone Amphan. South 24 Parganas, one of the worst-hit coastal districts, recorded a huge agricultural and associated loss of livelihoods as well.",1
799054,India to witness severe food inflation due to extreme weather,"The record-breaking vegetable price rise indicates an era of high food inflation in coming years

Rising prices of food items, particularly that of vegetables, have spiked retail inflation to a 68-month high of 7.59 per cent in January 2020, according to the National Statistical Office.

While the inflation figure captured headlines, a crucial analysis of the reasons behind this sustained increase in food prices slipped public attention. Extreme weather events have led to crop damages, leading to a collapse in the supply of vegetables at a time of the year when they usually flood the markets.

On the basis of year-on-year comparison, vegetable prices have gone up by 50.19 per cent since January 2019. They have spiked by 45.56 per cent in rural areas / markets during this period and by 59.31 per cent in urban areas.

Of the six categories of consumption items used to reach the overall inflation figure, the food and beverages category recorded the highest price rise, thus increasing the overall inflation rate.

Unseasonal rains and other weather events continue to disrupt the normal crop cycle and also crop yield. Since last year’s monsoon, at least 12 states have recorded longer spells of rains, spreading into the winter monsoon cycle of October-December.

A longer summer monsoon delayed sowing and harvesting. But it also raised the hope that higher moisture level would lead to higher Rabi crop yields. But during the winter monsoon — the primary season for vegetable crops — unusually high rainfall days were reported from across the country. It caused damages to standing crops.

In Matupali village of Odisha’s Subarnapur district, the weekly market is buzzing with one question: “Why is there no distress sale of vegetables?”

Like this market of an obscure village, difficult to pin point on the state map, shoppers in vegetable markets across Odisha find vegetable prices unusually high for this point of time.

Usually, in winter and particularly around February, seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and tomato crash to Rs 1-2 per kg. In Matupali’s market, cauliflower was selling at Rs 10 per kg and tomato at Rs 20 per kg respectively.

A typical weekly village market is usually the main market for local small producers and farmers. They have an explanation for this ‘price rise’ of vegetables. Since the monsoon last June-September, rains have continued; often they have experienced extreme spells of rains.

This has delayed the sowing and harvesting. As the rain continued till February, many standing vegetable crops got damaged. The farmers’ usual harvest has come down.

Even summer food grain crops like paddy had not been harvested till January-end. To sum up, the vegetable crop was delayed and got damaged in the continuing rains.

Even though a high retail price for vegetables would lead to better returns for farmers, their overall production has come down.

The erratic monsoon and more rainy days have already set the food inflation high since the last monsoon. Consumer food price inflation hit a six-year high of 14.12 per cent in December 2019.

One could gauge the impact of unfavourable weather events on food pricse from the fact that inflation picked up at fast pace, from 2.99 per cent in August 2019. In September 2019, it hit 5.11 per cent and in the next month, it reached to 7.89 per cent. In November 2019, inflation hit double digits — 10.01 per cent — for the first time since December 2013.

Way back in 2014, when inflation was an emotive political agenda, the Reserve Bank of India pointed out: “One of the traditional explanations for rising food prices has been the supply-side shocks related to weather either because of droughts or floods.”

Between 1956 and 2010, there were nine double-digit inflation episodes. Out of these, 77 per cent were caused by weather-related events like drought.

Non-profit Oxfam recently simulated the impacts of extreme weather events on price rise. According to this simulation: “The average price of staple foods such as maize could more than double in the next 20 years compared with 2010 trend prices (or by 2030) – with up to half of the increase due to changes in average temperatures and rainfall patterns.”

This simulation has another scary forecast that is relevant to India. It says that besides the price doubling by 2030, one or more extreme weather events could spike food prices to a level of two-decade cumulative price rise.

The fast food inflation during August-December 2019 in India could be an example of this when unseasonal and extreme weather events disrupted the crop cycle and damaged standing crops.

According to Oxfam, there would be a 107 per cent increase in the price of processed rice by 2030 due to extreme weather events.

“This scenario models the simultaneous occurrence of poor harvests in India and South East Asia and indicates that it could lead to an increase in 2030 in the global average export price of processed rice of around 25 per cent,” the Oxfam model forecasts.",1
799059,Five points on food inflation and onions,"Retail inflation hitting double digit being attributed to high food prices, but is it so?

When the National Statistical Office (NSO) declared that food inflation was 14.1 per cent in December 2019 due to spiralling vegetable prices, farmers in Karnataka were already doing distress selling of onions.

The food inflation in December last year is the highest in six years. Three vegetables — potato, onion and tomato — seem to have driven this high inflation. Their prices rose at 37 per cent, 328 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, according to the NSO report. This price rise is on a year-on-year basis.

So, when onion farmers in Karnataka, who were selling at Rs 200/kg just a few weeks ago, had to distress sale at around Rs 40/kg in the last few days, the pertinent question becomes: Is onion the culprit as it is being made out to be?

First, according to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFRI), India has been experiencing high food inflation post-2009 when a severe drought brought down agricultural production. But even after this year, high food inflation continued till 2015-16. Since then, it has been at moderate levels.

In an analysis of food inflation during 2006-2015 in India, IFPRI found it has been above seven per cent for all years except 2014 and 2015. In November 2013, it reached the highest — 14.72 per cent.

In December 2019, negative growth, or deflation was recorded at -2.65 per cent. After 2009, it was assumed that production would pick up, thus reducing food inflation. But it never happened, pointing at other structural issues that trigger food inflation.

Second, are these three vegetables (that are important in the Consumer Price Index basket) always responsible for high inflation? According to the decadal analysis by IFPRI, onion contributes just two per cent to overall food inflation while tomato contributes an insignificant one per cent. Rice contributes around 11 per cent. Milk at 22 per cent has the highest impact on food inflation.

There is, in fact, no standard trend to show which item generally impacts food inflation. But it depends on situations in a specific period. The current inflation seems to have been caused by both, onion and milk price rise.

Third, does this mean farmers are finally reaping a moderate, even though temporary, economic harvest? The onion farmers are certainly not gaining out of this unprecedented price hike.

The new harvests entering the market now have already corrected the price, like in Karnataka. To begin with, the government imported onions to curb inflation just before they could harvest and transport their produce to market.

Add to that the heavy damage they suffered due to extreme weather events. It means they have less quantity of onions to trade. Along with imported onions, the first flush of domestically-produced onion resulted in an immediate fall in prices, as we now see in Karnataka.

Fourth, onion is a highly profitable crop. But only if it reaches the market in the right condition and at the right time.

According to a committee set up by the government to recommend ways to double farmers’ income by 2022 as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, an onion farmer just gets around 43-44 per cent of the price at which s/he sells. Due to lack of proper storage and transportation, an onion farmer loses around 14.4 per cent of his / her produce, thus, further reducing earning.

Fifth, onion farmers are staring at a major market glut in the next four to five months. Irrespective of damages due to weather conditions last year, the market will be flush with new produce now.

In Karnataka and neighbouring states, onion rates are coming down due to this. The government has already put orders for over 36,000 metric tonnes of onions that have started arriving. In May, Indian farmers would add on to this when the second onion crop is harvested. This will flood the market, thus bringing down the price to an unsustainable level.",0
799265,Erratic monsoon affects Kharif sowing,"Share this

03 July 2021, New Delhi: Kharif sowing has started on a sluggish note despite monsoon delivering a 10 per cent surplus in June, the first of the four-month rainy season. Total acreage was down by 21 per cent as of June 25, compared with the same period a year ago as monsoon turned erratic in parts of Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, hurting the progress of sowing.

While transplantation of paddy, the main kharif crop, has started on a positive note, the planting of pulses, cotton and oilseeds has been rather tepid, according to early set of figures released by the Agriculture Ministry.

Paddy cultivation was higher by about 4 per cent at 36.15 lakh hectare (lh) over same period past year. States such as Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and West Bengal have reported higher acreage under paddy, while Odisha, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Chhatisgarh and Maharasthra have reported lower coverage.

Lower tur acreage

Area under pulses was 17 per cent lower compared with the year-ago period at 14.58 lh (17.51) . Acreage under tur or arhar was down by 37 per cent at 5.57 lh compared twith 8.83 lh. Urad or black matpe coverage was marginally down at 2.17 lh while moongbean area is slightly higher at 5.23 lh. States such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have reported higher area, while Maharashtra and Telangana have registered a decline. Pulses acreage in Maharashtra was down by 4.08 lh.

Area under coarse cereals dropped due to lower coverage of crops such as jowar, bajra and small millets. However, maize area is higher due to higher coverage in Karnataka.

Overall, the area under coarse cereals is higher in States such as Madhya Pradesh (4.32 lh) and Karnataka (1.43 lh). Lower coverage has been reported in Maharasthra (11.41 lh), Haryana (1.38 lh) and Rajasthan (0.79 lh).

Oilseeds coverage is also lower mainly due to lower acreage reported from Maharashtra (11.36 lh) and Gujarat (4.08 lh). Groundnut cultivation is down by a fourth at 9 lh (12.14 lh), while soyabean area is 42 per cent lower at 13.45 lh (23.36 lh). Rajasthan (1.46 lh), Madhya Pradesh (1.37 lh) and Karnataka (0.51 lh) have reported higher coverage.

Cotton area down by 48%

Cotton cultivation is down by 48 per cent at 37.14 lh (71.69 lh) as almost all major producing States have seen a sluggish planting. Cotton plating is down in Maharashtra (15.11 lh), Gujarat (8.15 lh), Madhya Pradesh (3.70 lh), Telangana (3.40 lh), Punjab (1.98 lh), Karnataka (0.83 lh), Haryana (0.63 lh), Rajasthan (0.60 lh) and Andhra Pradesh (0.32 lh).

Sugarcane acreage is higher at about 50.16 lh (49.85 lh) as Gujarat (0.80 lh), Maharashtra (0.17 lh) and Uttar Pradesh (0.12 lh) have reported an increase in area.

Though the south-west monsoon has weakened, it is expected to see renewed vigour by next week. The India Meteorological Department forecasts normal rainfall this month.

Water storage level

The Central Water Commission on Thursday said that the storage level in the 130 major reservoirs in the country is 55.606 billion cubic metres that is 32 per cent of live storage capacity at full reservoir level. This is one per cent lower than the level last year and 38 per cent higher than the average level seen in the last 10 years.",1
799297,Television had promised rain',"RAMESH YADAV, migrant auto driver, converses with NITIN SETHI on drought, media, politics and migration

• Part I: Untapped data

• Part II: Lessons learnt



How long have you been driving an auto in Ahmedabad?

Just about a fortnight now. I came about 25 days ago from Lucknow.



You live in Lucknow city?

No. Who lives in the cities? People come to the cities to work, not to live. I am from Dadara Bhadod, a village close to Lucknow. It is in district Sultanpur. You wouldn't know the place so I mentioned Lucknow instead.



What made you leave the village and come so far?

The monsoon failed in Uttar Pradesh. Things were getting bad in the village. There was no work and nothing could be sowed. We waited for a while, hoping it might rain. It didn't. Finally somebody from the family had to go out and earn some money. I am the only son in the family, and it fell upon me.



Your family...

My wife, paternal uncle and aunt (chacha and chachi) are in the village. My parents are in Ahmedabad. My father is a driver in the secretariat.



Oh, so your family is not completely dependent on agriculture?

Certainly not, we are much better off than many in our village. Uncle and I work the fields. Anyway agriculture is such a gamble. Who knows when you fall into the trap.



Trap?

Debt trap. Farmers always need loans. So you go to the lala. He charges exorbitant amounts. If the harvest is good, one can pay it off, else you have had it. One would think people in cities would know all this.



How bad is the drought this year?

Depends on whether you have irrigated fields or not. In my village about 30 per cent of the sowed area is irrigated. But agriculture on my land is rainfed. Thankfully we didn't sow too much, so we did not lose too much. The television promised it would rain. Some who listened to it have lost their entire labour.



Has the government helped?

Not yet. They have not declared our village drought-hit. So we will not get any special funds. I don't know what criteria they have for declaring a district drought-hit. But, please tell me, is this the way you manage a country -- relegate people to mere percentages? We do not expect any help. Whatever is to be done is to be done by us.



What do you mean?

How long can we wait to be rescued. I have to live; I have to feed my family. Should I wait till I become poor enough or hungry enough to qualify for help?



So I migrate. Everyone does. And please realise, my family is much better off. With father sending money from the city, we are not in as much of a fix as many others. Yet, people don't wait till they are in dire straits. At the first inkling that it could be a bad season, I migrated; got myself an autorickshaw.



How is your earning here?

I manage. Am able to earn about Rs 150 to Rs 200 daily. That is not bad because I stay with my father. I can work here for three or four months and then hope to get back. My wife is there, you know.



How many others have migrated from your village or its vicinity?

When a village is on fire, you scamper, not stay to count the huts burned down. Who knows, who wants to count? Thirty per cent men, 40 per cent of them must have moved out by now. Why are you asking such questions, are you a journalist?



Yes.

Ah...I see. The government and the newspaperwallahs like numbers, right? But misery is not a slave to large numbers. It's acute when it befalls even one person or one family. And, poverty is not just about hunger. Depravity and loss of esteem is also poverty. Waiting interminably for rains is poverty.



So are you going to publish all that I have said?



If you permit.

Please do, please do (laughs). You didn't tell me earlier you were from the media else I would have given you your kind of information?



My kind of information...

I used to work for the Samajwadi Party in our village. I know some politics and something about the newspaper business. Coming to Ahmedabad, I might have left it all behind me but I am not unfamiliar with how news works.



Anyway, where are you from?



Delhi.

No. Originally where are you from?



Uttaranchal.

See, we are all migrants. You weren't poor when you moved to the capital, I am sure. Poverty is not about lack of money alone. That is the most drastic form of it. Poverty is also a lack of opportunity. Look at the market in Ahmedabad on C G Road. You will see many guards and doormen clad in white dhoti and kurta, all moustached and wearing earrings -- they have all moved here from Rajasthan in search of work. The drought there is worse. These people are on the run. Write on them. Their story has more masala than mine.



Sorry, I love to talk. Can I have your card please, some phone number to contact you at. If I come to Delhi, can I call you?

799355,India is likely to experience strong relative impacts of climate change',"Overexploitation of groundwater reservoirs and dependence of surface water reservoirs on monsoon rainfall may lead to decreasing freshwater availability for agriculture in the country

A book published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) says that global warming will affect food production and lead to a reduction of nutritional properties of major crops.



Aziz Elbehri, senior economist, trade and markets division, FAO, and editor of the book Climate Change and Food Systems, tells Down To Earth how food availability will be climate driven in the years to come.



How is climate change related to food production and how important it is in determining its availability worldwide?



There are many ways (in) which climate change impacts food production. Climate change is manifested through changes in temperature (and) precipitation patterns, all of which affect plant, animal and fish growth processes, and hence, production.



Climate change also impacts food production through changes in water availability. Many water-stressed regions such as north Africa, Middle East, western USA, northern China, parts of India and Australia are expected to face heightened food production constraints from climate-induced water scarcity.



Some studies have reported that without additional productivity improvements, climate change would reduce crop yields between -20 and -45 per cent for maize, between -5 and -50 per cent for wheat, between -20 and -30 per cent for rice, and between -30 and -60 per cent for soybean.



What is more challenging to agriculture at present—increasing population pressure or local climate changes?



Climate change is only one of the major drivers, (affecting) future food availability. The other factors include population growth, economic growth, changing food consumption patterns and the extent of degradation of natural resources.



Both population growth and climate change are reinforcing each other in causing greater stress on agriculture. (As) population is growing steadily, the climate change challenge is expected to increase in intensity. Already at present, we are beginning to witness the consequences of the climate warming of the past 50 years with increased heat waves, extreme droughts and noticeable changes in seasonal patterns, all of which affect food production and availability.



In what ways farmers can increase crops yields and also at the same time practise sustainable agriculture?



There are different ways to increase yields and the model to use varies according to the context. In the 20th century, farmers in industrialised countries managed to increase yields through technological innovations, improved management, access to markets and policy support. In Asia, the green revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s increased yields of wheat and rice.



The challenge we face today is how to improve yields while at the same preserve the declining natural resources upon which the future productive capacity depends. The challenge is how to continue with yield improvements through crop intensification in a sustainable way.



Agriculture sustainability implies efficient use of resources coupled with conservation, protection and enhancement (of) natural ecosystems that sustain food production systems. FAO has been promoting the sustainable crop intensification programme (“save and grow”) and the concept of “climate-smart agriculture” which aims to achieve crop intensification, climate adaptation and mitigation.



How the increasing global demand for agricultural commodities putting pressure on land use?



There are several forces that combine to place increasing pressure on land use. Population growth and changing food consumption patterns are fuelling food production. Given that crop yields growth has slowed down in recent decades, in part due to slower agricultural research investments, more land is being brought under cultivation to meet (the) demand. This land use change can lead in some cases to deforestation.



Changes in consumption patterns, especially for meat and dairy, have also pushed grazing into forest lands More recently, the growth of biofuels has added to the competition as lands used for crops are now (being) used to produce biofuels.



You have said developing nations are more vulnerable to climate changes. Why is it so?



Convergent results are showing that climate change will fundamentally alter global food production patterns. Impacts on crop productivity are largely negative in low latitude and tropical regions (where most developing countries are located) and somewhat positive in high latitude regions (where most developed countries are located).



There are many indications showing that developing countries around the tropical regions will be relatively worse hit than Nordic countries (northern Europe, parts of Russia, Canada). For the latter, multiple cropping systems can even become feasible in future with possible increases in productivity. In the case of Europe, there is a considerable agreement that climatic suitability will improve cultivation.



For Africa, projected yield impacts are for the most part negative, except for areas that will experience higher rainfall and some elevated areas, which would benefit from increased temperature.



Many regions in low latitudes are expected to be negatively affected by reduced freshwater, including heavily irrigated areas in India, China and Egypt.



Low-lying-lands in Asia and other regions will be negatively impacted by the sea level rising (SLR). This is particularly a concern for farmers in Asian countries that grow rice along the river deltas and low-lying areas, and are therefore, prone to SLR, such as the Vietnamese Mekong Delta and the Ganges-Brahmaputra region.



How can Indian farmers mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and at the same time maintain optimum crop production?



India is likely to experience strong relative impacts of climate change and it is a top global producer of many crops. While India’s strong network of irrigation systems can help withstand some of the impacts of more erratic rainfall under climate change, the overexploitation of groundwater reservoirs and the dependence of surface water reservoirs on monsoon rainfall may lead to decreasing freshwater availability for agriculture and reduce productivity.



How India’s farmers can mitigate the impacts of climate change can only be answered within a particular local context. Assuming that a proper, multi-disciplinary impact assessment of climate on local farming systems is carried (out), the possible set of solutions will vary according to the situation at hand. Solutions need to be based on the principals of sustainable intensification and on adaptation and mitigation practices with co-benefits for food production and security.



How will climate change affect the global food trade? Apart from pushing up food prices, what will be the other implications?



Economic models show that trade can cushion against large production shocks due to climate and, if unrestricted, trade is expected to increase to compensate for production shortages or shifts for production patterns across regions due to climate.



Trade flows would increase from mid-to-high latitude to the low latitude regions, where production and export potential will be reduced. Climate change is also projected to cause wide variations in the net global food supply due to a higher frequency of droughts and extreme weather events.



Trade can also affect climate change. Increased economic activity, including trade, also increases (green house gas) GHG emissions. In some developing countries, with weak environmental laws, growing demands for food crops drive the expansion of production for exports (maize, rice, biofuel and feedstocks). In other cases, unregulated exports of forest products can exacerbate deforestation, land degradation and loss of biodiversity.",0
799585,"As rains fail again, catastrophic hunger looms over Somalia","Share this

07 June 2022, Mogadishu: A historic fourth consecutive failed rainy season, skyrocketing prices and an underfunded humanitarian response have resulted in a 160 percent increase in people facing catastrophic levels of food insecurity, starvation and disease in Somalia. With no end in sight for the devastating drought affecting the country, the risk of famine looms larger than ever. An urgent increase in support from the international community is essential to avert famine.

A new report from the Famine Early Warning Network and the Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, based on a rapid assessment by multiple United Nations agencies, shows that 7.1 million Somalis (close to 50 percent of the population) now face crisis-level food insecurity or worse through at least September 2022. Of those, 213,000 people face catastrophic hunger and starvation, a drastic increase from the 81,000 forecast in April. More areas are at risk of famine, particularly in the south of the country in regions where insecurity and conflict makes humanitarian access more challenging.

These figures reflect a food security situation that is expected to deteriorate rapidly over the coming months. United Nations agencies and partners are now focusing their limited resources on famine prevention to protect the country’s most vulnerable, as meteorological organizations warn that another below-average rainy season could follow later in the year.

“We are staring at a potential calamity; failure to act now will be tragic for scores of families in Somalia,” said Adam Abdelmoula, Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator. “Somalia is in danger of entering an unprecedented fifth consecutive failed rainy season, meaning hundreds of thousands of people face the risk of famine. Famine cost the lives of 260,000 Somalis in 2010-2011.This cannot be allowed to happen again in 2022. It is urgent that more is done to avert this risk and done now,” he said.

Collectively, humanitarian agencies have reached 2.8 million people between January and April 2022 with lifesaving and livelihood assistance through drought assistance and famine prevention programmes, but the new assessment clearly indicates that the scale of assistance currently being delivered and funding from the international community is not yet sufficient to protect those most at risk.

Food prices affecting the most vulnerable

Somali families are increasingly unable to cope with soaring food prices as local food has become scarce due to consecutive seasons of poor or failed domestic production, livestock deaths, and imported food prices reaching record levels – in part because of supply chain impacts due to conflict in Ukraine. In parts of the country, food prices have risen 140 to 160 percent, leaving poor families hungry and destitute.

“We must act immediately to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. The lives of the most vulnerable are already at risk from malnutrition and hunger, and we cannot wait for a declaration of famine to act,” said El-Khidir Daloum, WFP’s Country Director in Somalia. “It’s a race against time to prevent famine and WFP is scaling up as much as possible, prioritizing our limited resources to save those most at risk. But as these new figures show, there is an urgent need for more resources to meet this escalating hunger crisis,” he said.

Around 3 million livestock have died due to the drought since mid-2021, and the decline in meat and milk production has also led to worsening malnutrition, particularly among young children in pastoral areas who are dependent on local supply. As of May 2022, an estimated 1.5 million children under the age of five years face acute malnutrition through the end of the year, including 386,400 who are likely to be severely malnourished – an increase of 55,000 compared to previous estimates.

The malnutrition crisis is likely to worsen as the nutrition situation deteriorates further in the affected areas, with children and vulnerable people the hardest hit. “This is a child crisis. It’s not only about water or nutrition, but also about children losing education, falling vulnerable to child protection issues and having poor health; all impacting their future,” said Angela Kearney, UNICEF Somalia Representative. UNICEF has supported the treatment of more than 114,000 children with severe acute malnutrition between January and April 2022. “We are treating children but now we need further funding to prevent a famine and protect the future of every Somali child,” she said.

Grim situation as humanitarian funding falls far short

The grim food security situation is unfolding as humanitarian funding from the international community has so far fallen short of coming close to what actors need to avert a famine in the country. The 2022 Humanitarian Response Plan is currently only 18% funded. “The support required has not yet fully materialized, and hundreds of thousands of Somalis are at a very real risk of starvation and death,” said Etienne Peterschmitt, FAO’s Representative in Somalia.

“It’s a tragedy to see the level of distress that rural communities in particular are experiencing, and we are being limited in what we can do to prevent this extraordinary suffering. We’re calling on the international community to act fast while we still have some hope of preventing collapse of livelihoods, further and potentially massive population displacement from rural areas to IDP camps and widespread famine in Somalia,” he said.

796474,"Tamil Nadu's Tryst with Heavy Rain | What is Northeast Monsoon, How's It Different from its Summer Cousin?","The northeast monsoon has well and truly arrived with Chennai recording heavy rainfall for the third consecutive day on Tuesday. Tamil Nadu’s capital has not recorded such rainfall in the last 72 years, as the regional MeT recorded 8.4 cm of rain.

Overnight rains lashed the state capital’s neighbouring districts and other regions of Tamil Nadu, leading to flood-like situation. Some parts of the city and suburbs witnessed waterlogging, resulting in traffic congestion and slow movement of vehicles.

Schools have been closed in Chennai, Kancheepuram, Tiruvallur, Chengelpet, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts. Light to moderate rainfall is expected to continue in coastal and Cauvery delta regions of the state.

Monsoon in India

According to the National Geographic Society, the basic definition of monsoon is “seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing, or strongest, winds of a region”. These are most often associated with the Indian Ocean. The southwest (summer) monsoon and the northeast (winter) monsoon determine most of India’s climate, as .

What is the southwest or summer monsoon?

The southwest, or the summer, monsoon is the lifeline of India as it decides the state of agricultural productivity in the country and, in turn, the economy. While its pattern keeps changing, its set time of arrival, as per geographical estimate, is June with withdrawal in September. This year, the monsoon arrived in the first week of June but spilled onto October with heavy showers in the north and northwest of India. Hence, it can be said global weather patterns are also affecting the monsoon’s four-month time period, which has now been officially recognised by the India Meteorological Centre. Three years ago, the weather department pushed withdrawal dates from the north and northwest to the first or second week of October. This year, however, the monsoon’s complete withdrawal was stretched to the third week on October 23.

What is the northeast or winter monsoon?

Now, for the northeast monsoon, or the winter monsoon – this is, as of now, causing heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu. Lesser known than its rainy summer equivalent, this monsoon lasts between October and December. It mostly affects Tamil Nadu and the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh.

How are the two monsoons in India different from each other?

The summer monsoon accounts for heavy showers than the winter, which accounts for only 11 per cent of the total rainfall in India. It is defined by warm and moist air from the southwest Indian Ocean that blows toward countries like India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar at the end of winter. The summer monsoon brings a humid climate and torrential rainfall to these areas, as per the National Geographic Society.

But, its significance for India is much larger. Agricultural cycles in the country are defined by the southwest monsoon as many areas still do not have proper irrigation systems. The summer monsoon increases the levels of water in natural as well as man-made water resources. All agricultural activity, including animal farming, is associated with the summer monsoon. Even electricity is generated from hydroelectric power plants that depend on water collected during the monsoon. In short, the monsoon has often been called India’s “true finance minister” as the country’s economy is largely affected by the quality of rain received during the monsoon. A weak monsoon will mean a poor yield across most sectors, while a strong monsoon can cause irreparable damage with destroyed crops and flood-like situation or even devastating floods.

As for the winter, or northeast, monsoon, it is less powerful than the summer monsoon in Southeast Asia. This is due to the Himalayas preventing much of the wind and moisture of the monsoons from reaching the coast, as per National Geographic Society. The mighty and young fold mountains also prevent cool air from reaching South India and Sri Lanka, which keeps them warm all year.

In India, Tamil Nadu receives the bulk of its annual rainfall during the northeast monsoon between October and December. The state receives about 48 per cent of its annual rainfall of 914 mm during this time.

Rainfall is also received over parts of Puducherry, Kerala and Karnataka.

796630,Extreme rainfall damages nearly 4 million hectares of crops in Marathwada,"Incessant rains through the month of August and September have affected 4.48 million farmers this season

Farmers in Maharashtra’s Marathwada region suffered yet another severe blow due to incessant rains during August and September. This comes after the farmers had incurred severe losses worth crores of rupees during July, 2022.

Over 4.48 million farmers have suffered severe crop damage and this may increase over the coming months, according to the divisional commissionerate, Aurangabad.

Some 3,652,872 hectares (ha) of land have been affected due to the unexpected rains, of which 35,34,371 ha are rain-fed. Around 68,391 ha come under irrigation and 5,0,109 ha fall under horticulture.

The total sowing area in the Aurangabad, Beed and Latur districts was reported to be about 2,067,896 hectares this season, according to official estimates.

The division received rains in the last three weeks of September, making it over 100 per cent above normal. Aurangabad district received 165 per cent, 113 per cent and 130 per cent of rainfall between September 1 and 21, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

Beed received 122 and 116 per cent rainfall for the weeks September 7-14 and September 14-21 respectively. Latur, Jalna and Parbhani, Osmanabad and Hingoli districts also received excess rainfall resulting in large-scale crop damages.

Bapurao Kurumkar, a marginal farmer from the Beed district, said all his crops were damaged in the rains.

“September is the month when crops start bearing fruit and harvest begins. But just when I was about to harvest tur (pigeon pea) and soyabean, the rains caused severe damage,” he told DTE.

Kurumkar said his cotton plantation was also under threat. “I have planted all the crops in three acres (1.21 ha) of land and I fear that all the crops will be lost,” he said.

The cotton starts bearing pods and the October heat would have facilitated it. But with excess rains, the pods have been damaged, he added.

Farmers have started taking precautions to avoid any infestation as well.

“The unexpected rains make cotton crops vulnerable to infestation. I have sprayed insecticides and pesticides for the fifth time this season. However, the exercise has increased the input cost by three times,” said Dastagir Pathan, another farmer from Beed district.

The cost of spraying pesticides through the season has increased to Rs 60,000 due to incessant rains, said Dastagir, who co-owns six-acre (2.42 ha) with his two brothers.

“If I sell cotton, I am likely to earn the same amount of money. Given the heavy expenses, there will be no profits to sustain. Our fight is only to save the crops from extreme weather,” he added.

Other farmers from Marathwada told DTE they feared the remaining crops would also suffer damage if the rains continued.

The effect of the La Nina weather phenomenon will continue until year-end, resulting in more rains, including in the Indian subcontinent, stated the World Meteorological Organization, in its recent report.

The district administration officials have already started field inspections to assess crop damages. However, only limited relief has been disbursed by the state government

The divisional commissionerate has estimated damages to the tune of Rs 376,223 for farmers who have suffered more than 33 per cent of crop loss, making them eligible for crop damage compensation from the state government.

Funds worth Rs 1,688 crore have already been received from the state government, said Sunil Kendrekar, the divisional commissioner. “More funds will be requested as the reports of damages are updated and losses and measured,” he added.",1

Around 134,000 hectares of paddy crop in Punjab might have been destroyed by the heavy rain. Photo: @NavroopAgrifarm / Twitter

This has not been a good year for agriculture. Heatwaves and scarce rain during monsoon 2022, followed by heavy rain last week, destroyed standing crop across vast stretches in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

Sukhdeep Singh, a farmer in Punjab’s Ludhiana district, has been facing losses throughout the year. Heavy rains destroyed his potato crop on January 7, 2022.

The crop, planted on 10 acres, was almost ripe but was spoiled by the rainwater. Singh faced losses of Rs 20,000-25,000 per acre, meaning around Rs 2.5 lakh.

After this, the severe heat in March-April 2022 shrank his wheat crop. Singh had planted wheat on 18 acres. He usually cultivated 20-22 quintals per acre but could only harvest around six quintals per acre this time.

Singh again faced losses of Rs 2.5 lakh from the wheat crop. To make up for it, he leased additional land for paddy cultivation. Usually, he plants paddy on 30 acres of land, but this time he planted paddy on 35 acres to make up for his losses.

Timely rain on June 28, 2022, gave him hope for making up for his losses. It again rained on July 3, 2022, so he saved money on tubewell costs for a few days.

However, Singh’s hopes were dashed when the paddy crop was ready for harvest. Heavy rain on the night of September 25 completely flattened the crop. The paddy grain soaked water and swelled.

“My fields are still logged with water,” Singh told Down To Earth. “I can only calculate my losses once the water dries up. An acre produced 30-32 quintals of paddy. I will lose Rs 3-4 lakh over the damaged crop.”

Singh’s suffering is shared by farmers Jogendra Singh of Haryana and Sunil Kumar of Uttar Pradesh. There may be a distance of several hundred kilometres between them, but all three suffered major losses due to heavy rains last week.

Jogendra has eight acres of land in Ballabhgarh tehsil of Haryana. He planted two acres of paddy, two acres of cotton, two acres of jowar and two acres of bajra.

His cotton crop has spoiled completely. Paddy harvest has been delayed, but he hopes to save around half of it. Jowar and bajra also seem to be completely spoiled.

Jogendra’s losses go into lakhs of rupees, but he is also worried how to feed his cattle as the jowar crop can not be saved.

Kumar is a farmer from Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh whose joint family has 20 acres of land. “I grow paddy and sugarcane in the Kharif season. There was no rain in June-July, so I could not plant paddy them. I had to use water from tube wells to plant it later,” he told DTE.

The paddy crop was almost ready for harvest when the heavy rains struck last week. Now, Kumar’s crops lay flattened. “I don’t know if I can harvest anything,” he said.

There was very little rain in these three states in monsoon 2022, which affected agriculture. The few crops that were planted were destroyed by the heavy rain last week.

There were drought-like conditions in several states until last week. Now, the governments are under pressure to compensate for the damage caused by the rains.

Crops destroyed by the rain will be documented, Punjab Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal has told reporters. Around 134,000 hectares of paddy crop in Punjab might be submerged in rainwater right now.

The cotton crop has also been heavily affected. It was planted on 248,000 hectares in the current season in Punjab and 650,000 hectares in Haryana.

The Haryana government has also started the process of compensation for the damage caused by heavy rains. An online portal has been created and farmers have been asked to upload the information about their losses in 72 hours.

The patwari will review the applications, inspect the farms and then fix the compensation.

The government had earlier announced paddy procurement would begin October 1. However, farmers of Ballabhgarh said they do not have enough paddy left to sell.

The farmers had sown paddy earlier this time so that the crop reached the market by October and they could begin planting wheat on time in November when the fields become empty. However, this time only the late paddy crop is expected to survive.",1
796646,Monsoon 2022: Why a drought wasn’t declared in 4 states with drought-like conditions,"A report shows drought-like situation in over 700 blocks of 91 districts of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar & West Bengal

A severe deficit in the rainfall during monsoon 2022 has affected Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Bihar. However, state governments have shied away from declaring a drought in the states even though Kharif-sowing was badly hit.

Uttar Pradesh government directed a drought survey in all its districts September 8, 2022. The collection for tubewell bills for the three months of Kharif season, which started in June, has been put on hold.

Over 300 blocks in Uttar Pradesh are affected by drought, while 382 blocks are drought-prone, according to Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre (MNCFC), a central government agency. Over 700 blocks of 91 districts in the four states have been affected, a report said.

MNCFC was established in 2012 for in-season crop forecasts and assessment of drought situations using state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies developed by the Indian Space Research Organization.

There is a limited scope of improvement for crop production in blocks with rain-fed irrigation, the MNCFC report said. The analysis hinted at the poor condition of Kharif season cultivation in the states.

Over 7o blocks in 31 districts in UP were affected by drought-like conditions while 71 blocks are drought-prone, MNCFC said in the report. The state received 46 per cent less rainfall than usual from June 1 to September 8, 2022.

The state typically receives 647.3 millimetres of rain during this period, but it has received only 348.5 mm this year.

Only eight districts out of 75 districts have received average rainfall this time. Below average rainfall was recorded in 46 districts and 20 districts have received less than normal (less than 60 per cent) rainfall. Only one district has received above-normal rainfall.

Farukhabad has received 79 per cent less rainfall than normal, while Ghaziabad has an 80 per cent deficit. Gautam Budh Nagar saw a 78 per cent deficit, Rampur 73 per cent, Kushi Nagar 70 per cent and Baghpat saw 69 per cent less rain than normal.

Sant Kabir Nagar had a deficit of 65 per cent, Mau 62 per cent and Gonda recorded 63 per cent less rainfall.

Jharkhand fared the worst this monsoon, with a rainfall deficit of 26 per cent June 1 through September 8, 2022, compared with last year.

Paddy plantation decreased by 55 per cent compared with last year in Jharkhand, showed data collected through September 2, 2022. The sowing of pulses is down by 30 per cent.

The average rainfall for the state is 866.2 mm, but it has received 640.3 mm of rainfall so far. Only seven out of 24 districts in the state have received normal rainfall, while 15 received below average and two districts recorded below normal rainfall.

Over 60 blocks in Jharkhand’s 17 districts are drought-affected and 56 blocks are in drought-prone conditions, according to the report.

Similarly, 136 blocks in 32 districts of Bihar are drought-affected, while there is a possibility of drought in 162 districts. In West Bengal, 55 blocks of 11 districts are affected, while 63 have a high probability of drought, it said.

Paddy is the main Kharif crop in all four states and its production has been heavily affected due to the lack of rain. Farmers in these states could not sow paddy as rain, if any, happened after July.

The most favourable time for planting paddy is through July 15, said Abdus Sattar, assistant professor at Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University. “The seedlings fare the best in this period, as there is a possibility of damage during the heavy August rains,” the agricultural scientist said.

Over 1 million hectares of paddy crops dried up in Uttar Pradesh this year, according to media reports.

The question remains as to why a drought was not declared in July by the state governments when there was a severe shortage of rain.

The responsibility for drought declaration, relief and mitigation of drought lies with the state governments. The Center monitors and reviews the situation and helps the state government only when needed.

The National Disaster Response Fund or National Disaster Mitigation Fund is used only when the situation is dire.

The Joint Secretary (Drought Management), Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare September 7, 2022 presented a strategy for the Rabi season crops in a meeting by the Union ministry of agriculture.

The revised Manual of Drought Management, 2016, reduced the financial assistance by the Centre to states for drought management.

Read more: Monsoon 2022: Jharkhand farmers give up on paddy harvest due to scanty rains



Before the revision, only guidelines were given to the state governments under the Drought Management Rules 2009, which was not mandatory for the states.

The revised manual also removed the category of a ‘medium’ drought. This means that drought-affected areas will be classified as ‘normal’ or ‘severe’. Only in case of a ‘severe’ drought will a state be eligible for central assistance from the National Disaster Relief Fund.

The amendment of rules was opposed by some states including Karnataka. This may be the reason these four states are hesitant to declare a drought.

Now it remains to be seen whether Uttar Pradesh will declare a drought next week or not.",1

117,WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS INTO EARLY NOVEMBER FAVOR HARVEST ACTIVITIES,"The final full week of October, week-ending Oct. 29, began with very warm, almost summer-like temperatures across portions of the Corn Belt, but temperatures cooled down in the second half of the week. Rain, some of it heavy, fell in the southern Plains and up into southern Missouri with nearly an inch of rain, even up into Des Moines, Iowa. The rain helped improve drought conditions from eastern Oklahoma and northwest Arkansas to western Missouri. However, a large portion of the Mississippi and Ohio River Valleys saw drought severity increase, according to the United States Drought Monitor as of Oct. 25.

Temperatures for October 2022 as a whole in the Corn Belt trended closer to normal. Below average temperatures were more common in the eastern Corn Belt, while above average temperatures were more common in the western Corn Belt. Widespread freezing temperatures in the third week of October, week-ending Oct. 22, gave way to near summer-like warmth late that week. 

According to data from WeatherTrends360 this was the 3rd driest October in over 30 years for the Corn Belt as a whole. The dry conditions were favorable for fieldwork and harvest. However, as the winter season quickly approaches, the current state of drought is an indication of where we�ll start the 2023 planting season in terms of soil moisture and drought conditions.

In the short term, November 2022 will begin with warmer, abnormally dry weather in the Corn Belt. Much of the region will be between storm systems in the week-ending Nov. 5, which will keep a large portion of the area drier than normal. A cold front moving through late in the week will be the focus for showers and possible thunderstorms. Colder weather is expected in the northern Plains and upper Midwest by late in the week.",1
118,"HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE INDIAN CROPS AHEAD OF HARVEST, THREATENING HIGHER FOOD PRICES","MUMBAI, Oct 10 (Reuters) - Heavy rainfall in India has damaged key summer-sown crops such as rice, soybean, cotton, pulses and vegetables just before harvesting, which could stoke food inflation in Asia's third biggest economy, farmers, traders and industry officials said.

Higher food prices could prompt New Delhi to slap additional restrictions on exports of food commodities such as rice, wheat, and sugar, and potentially force the Reserve Bank of India to raise interest rates again.

""There has been so much rainfall from the last one week that now we can see sprouts from the paddy seeds,"" said Narendra Shukla, a 36-year-old farmer from Barabanki in Uttar Pradesh.

The entire paddy crop, which could have been harvested in a fortnight, has flattened and Shukla is now waiting for the weather to clear so he can finish the task and plant potatoes.

The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, the country's second biggest producer of rice, has received 500% more rainfall than normal so far in October.

Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Haryana and Rajasthan have also seen heavy rainfall, which has damaged summer-sown crops, dealers said.

That could lead to a reduction in yields and a deterioration in harvest quality, since crops were ready for gathering and in some places harvested crops were already drying, said Harish Galipelli, director at ILA Commodities India Pvt Ltd, which trades farm goods.

Indian farmers usually plant summer-sown crops in June-July with the arrival of monsoon rains, with harvesting starting from mid-September.

But this year the cycle was delayed by lower rainfall in June and while crops are now ready for harvesting, an area of low pressure is bring heavy rainfall in north-western and eastern parts of the country and delaying the end of the south-west monsoon.

Northern and eastern areas are expected to see heavy rainfall in the first half of this week, while southern India could get above average precipitation in the second half, said a senior official with the state-run Indian Meteorological Department.

Crop damage is likely to push already rising food prices up further, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.

""The government and RBI are under pressure to bring down inflation. The downward revision in crop production numbers means more and prolonged export curbs,"" the dealer said.

120,INDIA'S MONSOON RAINS COVER ENTIRE COUNTRY BUT STILL DOWN ON AVERAGE,"NEW DELHI, July 2 (Reuters) - India's annual monsoon covered the entire country on Saturday, six days earlier than usual, the state-run weather office said, but rain totals are 5% below average so far this season.

The monsoon, critical for farm output and economic growth in the world's second-most populous country, arrived on the coast of the southern Kerala state on May 29, a couple of days ahead of usual, yet after a promising start the rains gradually tapered off, clocking an 8% deficit in June.

Last month's patchy rains slowed the planting of rice, an essential summer crop.

India's rice farmers have planted 4.3 million hectares with the grain so far this season, down 27% from the same period last year.

The progress of the monsoon, which delivers about 70% of the country's annual rainfall, is crucial for rice output and exports from India, the world's biggest exporter of the grain.

Poor monsoon rains would further delay rice planting, stunt the crop and cut yields, leading to a drawdown in state inventories that would trigger export curbs to ensure sufficient supplies for the country's 1.4 billion people.

India is likely to receive monsoon rainfall between 94% and 106% of the long-term average in July, the most crucial month for planting rice and a host of other summer crops such as corn, cotton, soybean and sugarcane, the India Meteorological Department had said on Friday.

The weather office defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the entire four-month season beginning in June. Rain totals or between 90% and 96% are considered below average.

Bountiful monsoon rains in July would ease concerns about the output of summer crops, promising higher incomes in the countryside where most Indians live. As almost half of the country's farmland lacks irrigation, Indian farmers depend on the monsoon.

The farm sector employs more than half of the country's population and accounts for nearly 15% of India's $2.7 trillion economy, Asia's third-biggest. (Reporting by Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by David Holmes)",1
121,RAIN-TRIGGERED FLOODS IN BANGLADESH CONJURE CLIMATE WARNINGS," Scientists say that climate change was likely to have made the the rains that unleashed catastrophic flooding across Bangladesh worse.

While South Asia's monsoon rains follow natural atmospheric patterns, the rains will become more erratic and torrential as global temperatures continue to climb, scientists say.

It would take months to determine exactly how much of a role climate change played in last week's heavy rains.

But scientists note that warmer air can hold more water vapor before rain clouds eventually burst, meaning more rain eventually pours down.

""The strong monsoon winds in the Bay of Bengal can carry a lot more moisture,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. ""The large amount of rainfall that we see now might be a climate change impact.""

The South Asia monsoon season, from June to September, is governed by several, overlapping patterns in the ocean and atmosphere, including the El Nino-La Nina weather cycle and the Indian Ocean Dipole. Currently, those systems are driving strong, southwesterly winds over the Bay of Bengal.

But the monsoon patterns have shifted in recent decades, as the average temperature for Bangladesh has risen at least 0.5 degrees Celsius since 1976.

""Instead of having moderate rains spread out through the monsoon season, we have long dry periods intermittently with short spells of heavy rains,"" Koll said. ""When it rains, it dumps all that moisture in a few hours to a few days.""

On Tuesday, Bangladeshi troops were navigating dinghys through brackish floodwaters to rescue those in need or deliver food and water to some of the 9.5 million people marooned. Officials say at least 69 people have died in the disaster.

Last week's heavy rains, which caused Bangladesh's rivers to breach their banks, followed less than a month after the neighboring Indian state of Assam was hit by similar rain-triggered flooding, which killed at least 25 people there.

Bangladesh is considered one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, with a 2015 analysis by the World Bank Institute estimating about 3.5 million Bangladeshis are at risk of river flooding every year. The floods also threaten the country�s agriculture, infrastructure and clean water supply.

The region's countries ""all suffer if there�s no rain. They suffer when there�s too much rain,"" said Anders Levermann, a climate scientist at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Columbia University. ""What they would need is a steady rainfall, as we had in the past and as is threatened now under global warming."" (Reporting by Gloria Dickie; Editing by Katy Daigle and Angus MacSwan)",1

125,CLIMATE CHANGE LIKELY MADE PAKISTAN'S EXTREME RAINFALL MORE INTENSE -STUDY,"The torrential monsoon that has submerged more than a third of Pakistan was a one in a hundred-year event likely made more intense by climate change, scientists said on Thursday.

In the hardest-hit areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces, where August rainfall was seven to eight times heavier than usual, climate warming made average five-day maximum rainfall about 75% more intense, according to a report https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/analysis/rainfall/ by World Weather Attribution (WWA), an international research collaboration that teases out the role of climate change in extreme events.

Across the entire Indus River basin, the scientists found maximum rainfall was about 50% heavier during a two-month monsoon period due to climate change.

They used 31 computer models in their analysis, combined with real-world observations.

WWA previously analysed the deadly heatwave that scorched India and Pakistan in March and April, with temperatures reaching 50C. Climate change, they said, had made that heatwave 30 times more likely.

Their findings were less concrete for Pakistan's heavy rains.

""The role of climate change in heatwaves is much larger than in extreme rainfall when it comes to likelihood,"" said WWA co-leader Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.

It's also trickier to parse out the role of climate change in the Pakistan floods, scientists said, because there have been so many drivers behind this year's extremes.

Ongoing La Nina conditions - a global weather pattern that can affect ocean temperatures - combined with a negative dipole in the Indian Ocean - whereby rainfall is heaver in the eastern Indian Ocean � have been feeding the monsoon.

EXISTING VULNERABILITIES

The floods have so far claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people and displaced millions, washing away roads, homes, and farmland. Damages are expected to total more than $30 billion.

Pakistan authorities say it could take up to six months for flood waters to fully recede, spiking concerns about waterborne diseases such as dengue and cholera.

While climate change may have made this year's monsoon rains worse, the devastation they caused can�t be attributed to warming alone.

Scientists stressed the construction of homes and agricultural land on known flood plains, as well as inadequate infrastructure such as dams, had worsened the impacts of heavier rains.",1
126,A RAINY REPRIEVE FOLLOWED BY DRYNESS LATE THIS MONTH,"Some private weather services are expecting a hot and dry July. David Tolleris, WxRisk.com, isn�t one of them. The weather models he watches and analyzes from Europe, the U.S., and Canada aren�t in complete agreement but they�re showing rain in much of the Corn Belt for the first half of this month.

Tolleris expects a drier second half of the month, but not the hot temperatures currently to the west of the Corn Belt.

�In order for that heat ridge to come east, we need that trough in the jet stream that�s over the Great Lakes and New England to go away. So far, that�s not happening,� he says.

5-DAY WEATHER OUTLOOK
Rain is already developing in the western Corn Belt that�s expected in the most recent one- to five-day outlook for July 8-12.  It�s following a cold front.

�In the one-to-five day, a lot depends on where you�re located,� he says.

Tolleris says the operational GFS model used in the U.S. is driving the cold front too far to the south too fast, resulting in less rain in northern and western Iowa than other models. But the European and Canadian models have a much more uniform rain shield in the western Corn Belt, which makes more sense to Tolleris.

�The key to this whole situation is the development of the closed upper low in the western Corn Belt. If that feature does not form, the rainfall amounts are going to be considerably less,� he says in his daily report.

6- TO 10-DAY WEATHER OUTLOOK
Starting this weekend, and continuing into the six- to 10-day period, �there is going to be a large, closed upper low over Missouri and Iowa,� Tolleris says. �What does that do? It creates a very unstable atmosphere.� That has the potential to �bring about significant if not heavy rains for much of the next 10 days.�  The GFS model used by the U.S. has that rainfall weakening in the western Corn Belt. The European and Canadian models do not.  

11- TO 15-DAY OUTLOOK
�There is no doubt that the rainy pattern is going to come to an end in the 11-to-15 day,� Tolleris says. �When we get into the last 10 days of July, it�s going to turn dry again in the Midwest.�

Both the intermediate and longer-term outlooks from computer models match well with the historical pattern tied to the Madden-Julian Oscillation, he says. The MJO is characterized by thunderstorms that develop over the Indian ocean and move eastward over the Pacific toward Peru. These storms send out energy that affects weather far from that region, even into the Midwest.",0
127,UPDATE 1-INDIA LIKELY TO GET AVERAGE MONSOON RAINS IN 2022,"MUMBAI, April 14 (Reuters) - India is likely to receive normal monsoon rains this year, the state-run weather office said on Thursday, raising prospects of higher farm and general growth in Asia's third-biggest economy.

The rains, which usually lash the southern tip of Kerala state around June 1 and retreat by September, are expected to be 99% of the long-term average this year, the India Meteorological Department said in a statement.

New Delhi defines average, or normal, rainfall as ranging between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches)for the four-month season beginning in June.

""The encouraging forecast of a normal monsoon in 2022, coupled with healthy reservoir levels in all regions, augurs well for a timely onset of summer crop sowing,"" said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at rating agency ICRA, the Indian arm of Moody's.

The monsoon is crucial for the $2.7-trillion economy, as it brings nearly 75% of the rain needed by farms, besides replenishing reservoirs and aquifers.

Nearly half of India's farmland gets no irrigation and is dependent on the annual rains from June to September. Farming accounts for nearly 15% of the economy but sustains more than half of a population of 1.3 billion.

Key cotton, soybean and sugarcane growing regions in northern parts of peninsular India, central India, the foothills of the Himalayas and some northwestern areas are likely to get normal to above normal seasonal rainfall, the IMD said.

Tea, rubber and rice growing regions in northeast India and southern parts of the peninsula could receive rainfall that is below normal, it added.

India is the world's biggest producer of cotton and pulses and the second biggest producer of sugar, wheat and rice. It is also the world's biggest importer of edible oils such as palm and soy.",1
128,INDIA'S RICE PLANTING LAGS LAST YEAR AFTER LOW RAINFALL,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, July 1 (Reuters) - India's rice farmers have planted 4.3 million hectares with the grain so far this season, farm ministry data showed on Friday, down 27% from the same period last year after lower than usual June rainfall.

Millions of Indian farmers plant crops such as rice, corn, cotton, soybeans and sugarcane in the monsoon months of June and July, with the harvest starting in October.

India is likely to receive monsoon rainfall between 94% and 106% of the long-term average in July, the most crucial month for the planting of summer crops.

The weather office defines average rainfall as between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the entire four-month season beginning in June. Rains between 90% and 96% are considered below average.

""West Bengal, Odisha and Chhattisgarh immediately need two to three good spells of rain, or both the area and productivity could be affected,"" said one Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm, referring to the top rice-growing states in the world's biggest exporter of the commodity.

Rice planting could pick up, but low rainfall could hit crop yields, said the dealer, who declined to be identified because he is not authorised to talk to the media.

129,"FORECAST OF HEAVY RAINS IN OCTOBER RAISES CONCERN ABOUT INDIA'S RICE, WHEAT CROPS","MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Sept 30 (Reuters) - India is likely to receive above-average rainfall in October, an official with the state-run weather office said on Friday, posing risks for summer-sown crops such as rice and the planting of wheat.

Monthly rainfall is expected at 115% of the long-term average, Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of the India Meteorological Department, told a virtual news conference.

Heavy rains in October could damage ripening crops such as rice, pulses, cotton and soybeans, and may delay wheat planting in parts of India, the world's leading producer of an array of farm goods.

Scant rain in eastern and northern India in the first half of the June-September monsoon season had already hit rice planting, forcing the government to cut output estimates and restrict exports to ensure adequate supplies for the country's 1.4 billion people.

The curbs came on the heels of a ban on overseas sales of wheat after a sudden rise in temperatures in March and April shrivelled the crop.

Although monsoon rains were patchy in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and parts of West Bengal - some of India's major rice-producing states - overall summer rains were 6% higher than average during the four-month season as central and southern regions received torrential downpours.

India is increasingly seeing uneven monsoon rains, raising concerns about food output. Rains are also getting more intense during the tail end of the season, and lingering.

This year, the monsoon could last longer than normal, especially in northern India, Mohapatra said.

Although a longer monsoon tends to help winter crops by leaving the soil moist and replenishing reservoirs, unusually heavy downpours hamper agricultural activities.

""Crops are getting ready for harvesting and they need dry weather,"" said a New Delhi-based dealer with a global trading firm.

""Excessive rainfall could damage crops, especially rice in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal,"" said the trader who did not wish to be identified in line with his company's policy.

Within weeks of harvesting the rice crop, millions of Indian farmers start planting wheat in October. Growers harvest the wheat crop in March and April.

Monsoon rains are critical for India's farm-dependent economy, as almost half of the country's farmland goes without irrigation. Farming accounts for nearly 15% of India's almost $3 trillion economy and sustains half of its population.

Cyclone destroys crops on at least 6,000 hectares in Bangladesh

Exports rates little changed in Thailand, Vietnam

By Ashitha Shivaprasad

Oct 27 (Reuters) - Prices of rice from top exporter India edged up this week on an uptick in the rupee and supply concerns, while a cyclone destroyed crops in Bangladesh at a time when it was already struggling to tame high local rates for the staple.

India's 5% broken parboiled variety <RI-INBKN5-P1> was quoted at $375-$384 per tonne, down from $374-$382 last week.

The size of the Indian crop would be lower than earlier expectations as rainfall has damaged paddy in northern and north-eastern states, said an exporter based at Kakinada in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.

Heavy rainfall damaged crops just before harvest in key producing states such as Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh earlier this month.

Neighbouring country Bangladesh, meanwhile, was grappling with the aftermath of cyclone Sitrang, which struck on Monday.

The storm destroyed rice crops on 6,000 hectares, according to preliminary estimates from the agriculture ministry, in a likely blow to the country, which has been trying to bring down elevated domestic prices after floods earlier this year destroyed 254,000 tonnes.

Prices of Vietnam's 5% broken rice <RI-VNBKN5-P1> were unchanged at $425-$430 per tonne free-on-board.

""Farmers are making profit from the current price, and this will encourage them to invest more in the upcoming winter-spring crop, the largest of the year,"" a trader in Ho Chi Minh City said.

The government on Wednesday forecast Vietnam's rice exports in the first 10 months of the year at 6.07 million tonnes, up 17.2% from last year. October exports were forecast at 700,000 tonnes.

Preliminary shipping data showed 387,050 tonnes to be loaded at Ho Chi Minh City port during Oct. 1-28, with most of it heading to the Philippines, Africa, Cuba and Bangladesh.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices <RI-THBKN5-P1> were also little changed at $405 per tonnes.",1

136,Poor monsoon could spell disaster for India's agri-based economy: Experts,"Already reeling under the after-effects of tormenting heatwaves, India cannot afford to have a poor monsoon which could spell disaster for its agriculture-based economy, experts have said, hoping a revival of monsoon rains will ease food inflation and ensure food security.

The monsoon accounts for around 70 per cent of the country's annual rainfall and irrigates 60 per cent of its net sown area. Nearly half of the population depends on agriculture directly or indirectly.

A bad monsoon invariably means bad crop production and inflation.

An early onslaught of heatwaves has already impacted rabi crops, prompting the government to curb wheat exports and cut output predictions by roughly 5 per cent from 111.3 million tonnes to 106.4 million tonnes.

Another disruption in the weather pattern can have serious consequences in terms of the country's food security.

While the MeT office has predicted a normal monsoon for the fourth year on the trot, its slow progress in the first half of June sparked fears about a delay in the sowing of crops such as paddy.

However, the weather department says it is expected to pick up pace and compensate for any deficiency.

The prediction is good and the rainfall is picking up. The countrywide rainfall deficit has decreased from 43 per cent on June 11 to 18 per cent on June 17, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Director General (D-G), India Meteorological Department (IMD).

Normal rainfall activity will continue in peninsular India, east and central parts of the country and the Northeast, he said, adding that the precipitation in northwest India will increase after June 23.

Mohapatra said monsoon never leads to an even rainfall distribution across all regions.

If we look at spatial distribution, some areas will get less rainfall; some will get more. The quantum will be normal and that is what we have predicted, the IMD D-G said.

He said La Nina conditions, considered good for the monsoon, will continue till the end of the season, but will be countered by the projected negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), known for obstructing the progression of the monsoon over India.

The net result will be a normal monsoon, the meteorologist added.

G P Sharma, president (meteorology), Skymet Weather, said it looked like the monsoon had hit a roadblock as it entered the third week.

The country received deficient rainfall as far as the agriculture sector is concerned, he said, attributing the sluggish start to the absence of a ""driving system like offshore trough, cyclonic circulation, among others"".

But that is going to change soon. A cyclonic circulation will come up over parts of West Bengal, north Odisha and adjoining Bangladesh in three to four days which will change the wind pattern in the Indo-Gangetic plains, the meteorologist said on Friday.

""This cyclonic circulation will initiate the typical easterly flow which is crucial for the advance of the monsoon into northwest India,"" he said.

Central parts of the country, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, adjoining Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, are the core monsoon rain-fed area and therefore, are the most vulnerable.

Farmers in Punjab and Haryana do not depend on monsoon. They have their resources and irrigation network -- tube wells, canals, among others. Whereas central India eagerly waits for monsoon rains, he said.

A delay in the monsoon poses a greater risk to Maharashtra, as it is a large state stretching from the Konkan coast to Vidarbha and has diverse weather conditions.

But the situation is becoming better. The disappointing phase has ended at least for the month of June. The rain-fed areas are expected to do well, Sharma said.

Principal Scientist and Professor, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Vinod Sehgal said rainfall deficit will be compensated by the end of June.

The outlook is good and it appears to be reviving. We should get good rains in July. The situation is not so concerning. A large rainfall deficit that extends into the first week of July is considered disastrous for the Kharif crop, he said.

A good rainfall is all the more necessary because the prolonged heatwaves have sucked the moisture from the soil, the scientist said.

Sehgal attributed the food inflation to heatwaves and volatile global markets.

Globally, the demand for wheat grew due to the Russia-Ukraine war. The two nations together export a quarter of the world's wheat.

The increase in crude oil prices and the weakening of Rupee also leads to diversion of a substantial amount of foodgrain for the production of bio-ethanol which in turn leads to food inflation, the IARI professor explained.

Food and trade policy expert Devinder Sharma said deadly heat waves have already hit the wheat yields this year and the country needs a normal monsoon for adequate rice production.

Punjab has 98 per cent of its crop area under assured irrigation. But not all regions of the country have this advantage, he said.

The monsoon has been sluggish in the first part of June, with the rainfall deficit piling up to 80 per cent in some parts of the country. It will certainly impact the yield, Sharma said.

Reports suggest that the second half of the monsoon will be volatile. Some reports say the rainfall deficit will continue over the next two months. It does not paint a very good picture.

""If the rainfall deficit continues into the second and third week of July, it will have serious ramifications. Let us be very clear, we cannot afford another disruption in the weather pattern. If it happens, we won't be able to bear the consequences,"" he warned.",0

ensing that the crop arrival will be delayed, wholesale prices of mustard oil have shot up by Rs 5 per litre over the last one week.

The unseasonal rainfall that started from the second week has been beneficial for some crops, while impacting the growth of few others.

","Chandigarh, The country's wheat output is expected to be 112 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year, almost five million tonnes more than last year's rabi harvesting season, with rise in area under high-yielding varieties contributing to this, said Gyanendra Singh, Director of Karnal-based ICAR-Indian Institute of Wheat and Barley Research (IIWBR). Singh ascribed expected increase in wheat production to favourable weather conditions, increase in acreage and rise in area under high-yielding crop ..
""We are having a good winter. Planting has been done timely. Everything as of now is very good,"" said Singh when asked about wheat crop sown.

On area under wheat cultivation in the country, Singh said area under the winter crop this season was around 33 million hectares, which was expected to be up by 1.5 million hectares over last year.

Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan are among key growing areas for the wheat crop in the country.

""I am expecting 112 million tonnes of wheat crop. It will be 5 million tonne more than last year. There are three reasons for expected increase in wheat output. The area has increased slightly, favourable weather and thirdly, the area under new varieties has increased,"" he said.


The high-yielding varieties include DBW 187, DBW 303, DBW 222 and HD 3226, he said, adding that these varieties are sown mostly in Haryana, Punjab, west UP and Rajasthan.

""These varieties are also recommended for eastern UP, Bihar and two of them are ..

Farmers were made aware to go for newer varieties and for which seed was also made available. So, the area under newer varieties has increased this time, he added.

When asked how much effect on yield these new varieties have, the director of IIWBR said the yield increases by over ten quintals per hectare with new varieties.

If farmers are growing old varieties and if they grow new varieties, 10-15 quintals advantage is always there. Because they (new varieties) are climate resilient and they will have the least effect of changing weather,"" he noted.

Singh said the weather conditions at present are favourable. ""Our expectation is that there should be some rain, which is always good at this stage.

143,"Climate change outside pushes veggie crops inside

","The salad days are over. Thanks to drought, disease and Covid-related supply chain disruptions, romaine lettuce prices have surged more than 50% since January 2020. Other leafy greens have jumped, too. In response, some restaurants, including Subway and Chick-fil-A, recently warned they'll reduce lettuce portions or suspend them altogether. Inflation-shocked consumers won't be far behind.



It's a fresh-veggie crisis and United Natural Foods, Inc., a grocery wholesaler that distributes food to 30,000 locations across North America, has a solution. Next year it will open an indoor high-tech vertical farm devoted to herbs and other greens in the parking lot of one of its Wisconsin distribution centers. The concept of indoor farming has been around and expanding for years. But thanks to technological advances and consumer demand for reliable sources of locally grown foods, a new g ..

Indoor growers aren't required to label how their produce is grown, though, so many consumers have no idea that they're buying into a food revolution. Long term, that's a recipe for mistrust and accusations of �factory farming.� Fortunately, that can be avoided with something as simple as a voluntary approach to labeling products so that consumers associate them with sustainability, localisation and flavor.

In the mid-20th century, scientists in California developed electrically lit, climate-controlled facilities in which crop yields exceeded those achieved outdoors. Unfortunately, the power demands of these controlled environments made them too expensive to be commercially viable, especially compared to traditional field agriculture.

But interest in developing controlled-environment agriculture � or CEA, as it's known today � didn't subside. In the 1970s, innovators determined to bring agriculture into urban areas developed vertical farming, a technique in which layers of crops are stacked in climate-controlled indoor facilities. Soil is typically replaced by nutrient-rich hydroponics and aeroponics (roots are exposed and bathed in a mist) and water is recycled, boosting sustainability and yields beyond what can be achie ..
These days, there are more than 2,000 vertical farms in the US, and many have opted to move their technologies, micro-climates and crop stacks into insulated, shipping container-size modules. Brooklyn-based Square Roots, founded in 2016, operates a technology platform that incorporates automated seeding, harvesting and sanitisation. Meanwhile, software manages every aspect of the growth cycle, allowing the company to control more than 100 different parameters that ""customise"" the produce. Tobias ..


That hyper-localisation of production has benefits beyond specialty restaurant kitchens. Thanks to extreme, variable weather caused by climate change, some of the world's most important agricultural regions are experiencing dropoffs in agricultural production. For example, the ongoing drought in California, the worst in recorded state history, idled 750,000 acres of irrigated land this year � an area more than 50 times greater in size than Manhattan. For consumers, that�s meant re ..

But interest in locally sourced food began long before drought and Covid disruptions. The farm-to-table movement of the 1970s advanced the idea that local produce is fresher and tastier because it doesn't need to be trucked from California to, say, Wisconsin. The problem, of course, is that Wisconsin's traditional farmers are limited in their ability to grow most crops that thrive in California.
Those limits don�t apply to indoor growers outfitted with climate-controlled modules that run all year long. UNFI, a major wholesaler of natural and organic foods to retailers, including Amazon.com Inc.-owned Whole Foods, noticed. It invited Square Roots to set up a 20,000 square-foot farm at one of its distribution centers near the Twin Cities. Produce grown there will be distributed to hundreds of outlets in Minnesota and Wisconsin.


These high-tech artificially lighted farms may not be what many consumers envision when they think of ""locally sourced"" greens, but they�re contributing to a more resilient supply chain of fresher food that doesn't require extensive trucking � among the key goals of the grow-local movement. Farms located at distribution points also provide economies of scale that can't be achieved by locating smaller indoor farms at individual supermarkets. Some analysts project that the industry could be worth  ..

Nonetheless, even the most enthusiastic advocates don�t expect indoor farms to replace outdoor agriculture. There will never be the capacity indoors to replace vast fields of wheat and rice, for instance. Even most traditional salad ingredients, such as iceberg lettuce, won�t move inside anytime soon, says Dorn Wenninger, vice president of produce at UNFI. From a business standpoint, the key opportunity is to steady supply chains that are increasingly strained and broken and to provide consumers ..

""Temperatures at the moment are high. If they continue to remain high then there can be productivity loss in wheat crop,"" Karnal-based Indian Institute of Wheat & Barley Research, director, Indu Sharma told PTI today.

Minimum temperatures in the most parts of Punjab and Haryana are hovering around 5-6 degrees above normal.

""The minimum temperatures should remain lower (than what is now) at this stage for better yield of wheat,"" she said.

She also expressed concern the higher temperatures would also increase the chances of the attack of yellow rust.

""There are very high chances of the spread of yellow rust at this moment as multiplication rate of fungus go up due to higher temperatures,"" she warned.

The disease appears as yellow-coloured, powdery linear stripes on the leaves. When touched with fingers the yellow-coloured spore mass sticks to the fingers, which is a conspicuous criteria for disease identification.

If not checked in time yellow rust can cause tremendous losses in yield, experts said.

Yellow rust has already been spotted at Anandpur Sahib, Nanbal in Punjab, Kangra, Una in Himachal Pradesh and Yamunanagar in Haryana.

Rainfall will be heavier along the West Coast (from Coastal Karnataka to Mumbai) and adjoining interior Maharashtra (Madhya Maharashtra and Marathawada), as well as in North Interior Karnataka; normal to slightly above-normal in Central and East India (South Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, East Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, East Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and adjoining foothills, West Bengal and adjoining the North-Eastern States.)

According to the Japanese forecast, rainfall will be normal to below-normal over most of Odisha and the northern parts of the North-Eastern States. Its above-normal forecast for the country as a whole corresponds with the India Meteorological Department's (IMD) upgrade of the monsoon from 95% to 103% above the long-period average during this season. This is despite its slow progress thus far, with many areas in East and Central India still waiting for the first showersThe Japanese agency forecasted that India, along with western and northern parts of Canada, Central America, Venezuela, Guyana, eastern Australia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Nepal, some parts of China, Eurasia and Indochina, and Indonesia, would likely experience wetter-than-normal rainfall during the reference period.

However, drier-than-normal (lower-than-normal rainfall) conditions are forecast for most of North America, northern South America, La Plata, Chile, West and Central Africa, the northern Mediterranean, and parts of China, Eurasia, Indochina, and the Philippines.

The Japanese outlook comes after the country declared that a monsoon-unfavorable negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) had formed. It will mature throughout the monsoon season and beyond before decaying in the winter. When the dipole index falls below -1.5 degrees Celsius, there is an increased (80%) chance of it becoming an extreme negative IOD (currently it is around -.5 degree Celsius).

The overarching extended La Nina in the Equatorial Pacific, which has traditionally been considered beneficial for a concurrent monsoon in India, is expected to last into September and December, well beyond the South-West monsoon. Given this, it is likely that the Indian Ocean and the Pacific will compete for dominance; however, if India is to have a good monsoon, La Nina must prevail.",1

796476,Neighbour’s envy: India’s jute economy is faltering while Bangladesh’s is flourishing; here’s why,"Lack of market, government procurement and diversification, poor infrastructure as well as the sorry state of Indian jute mills is responsible, say experts

The director of Hukumchand Jute Mill in North 24 Parganas says it has become difficult to find workers willing to work in a jute mill due to low wages (Photo : Shagun)

“Just 10 years ago, this whole area was under jute, as far as the eye could see. Not anymore,” Narayan Ghosh said while pointing at a vast stretch of farmland in Saguna village of West Bengal’s Nadia district.

“The vegetation was so dense and the plants so tall, over three metres, that the traders who came to buy jute did not dare to enter the fields alone for fear of being lost,” Ghosh, a farmer who owns 0.5 hectares (ha) in the village, said.

Ghosh’s words best capture the decline of India’s jute economy. Production of the cash crop has fallen by over 13 per cent in the past decade — 1.77 million tonnes in 2021-22, from 2.03 million tonnes in 2011-12 — according the third advanced estimates released by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare in May 2022.

The same is the case with land under jute. The average area under jute in the country was 0.82 million ha between 2000-01 and 2009-10, according to a 2021 report by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). This declined to 0.73 million ha between 2010-11 and 2019-20.

In West Bengal — the country’s largest jute-producing state, which also has 70 of India’s 93 jute mills — the area under jute has reduced by 0.1 million ha between 2009-10 and 2020-21.

Jute can be highly profitable. Its leaves are sold in markets as a vegetable even before the crop is harvested. The inner stem can be used to manufacture paper while the outer layer produces the fibre. What, then, ails the jute economy?

“There is no market for it,” Ghosh said. Ten years ago, he used to grow jute across his 0.5 ha, but gradually reduced and stopped cultivating the crop by 2011, shifting to horticulture crops.

“The jute price kept falling. From Rs 30,000-40,000 per tonne in late 2000s, it reduced to Rs 25,000 in 2010-11. This was barely enough to recover the input cost,” he said. Other farmers in the village agreed that jute stopped fetching fair price and was even causing losses.

When the prices fell, the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) Ltd, a Government of India enterprise for procurement of raw jute from the growers at the minimum support price, barely intervened.

This reflected in official procurement figures as well. Between 2007-08 and 2021-22, the quantity procured by JCI decreased to 0.014 million tonnes, from 0.14 million tonnes.

The poor procurement figures came despite the government being the largest buyer of jute bags, which form the highest share of the total jute products manufactured in the country.

There is a special law — the Jute Packaging Materials (Compulsory Use in Packing Commodities) Act 1987 (JPMA) — that provides for use of jute packaging material for foodgrains. Under this Act, the government issues orders from time to time for mandatory use of jute packaging.

Since 2017, the norms provide that 100 per cent of foodgrains and 20 per cent of sugar should only be packed in jute bags. Due to this, jute sacks account for 75 per cent of the total production of the jute industry.

Ninety per cent of the jute sacks are supplied to the Food Corporation of India and state procurement agencies, according to a Union government press release dated November 10, 2021, while the remaining are exported or sold directly. It also says the government purchases jute sacks worth Rs 8,000 crore every year from mills.

The Bangladesh story

While India’s production and acreage declined, Bangladesh’s production and area under jute has increased over the years. India is still the largest producer of jute but in terms of acreage, Bangladesh is the largest cultivator. It also accounts for nearly 75 per cent of the global jute exports, while India’s share is just 7 per cent, according to the CACP report.

Ironically, even India imports jute products (yarn, floor coverings and jute hessian) from Bangladesh, according to the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry. In 2020- 21, India imported products worth Rs 1,123 crore from Bangladesh.

The CACP report said imports from Bangladesh had adversely affected the domestic industry, given that the landed price of jute and its products from the neighbouring country was less than the domestic rate.

Bangladesh has traditionally enjoyed a comparative advantage in export of jute products because of its low cost of production driven by lower wages, favourable power tariffs, cash subsidy for export and better fibre quality.

Quality, in particular, has been a sore point in India’s jute cultivation. Jute in India is marred by poor infrastructural facilities for retting, a process done after harvesting of the crop.

Under retting, jute bundles are kept under water at a depth of about 30 cm. This process gives the fibre its shine, colour, and strength. It should ideally be done in slow moving, clean waterbodies like rivers. But Indian farmers do not have access to such resources.

Sajjan Mallick, who has 1 ha under jute in Saguna, said there was no free flowing water body in his village. He pointed to a small pond, where hundreds of farmers submerge their jute bundles in muddy water for days.

“When we take them out, there is a discolouration,” he said. There is another bigger pond at a distance, but with jute being a bulky crop, moving bundles raises labour costs.

To overcome such concerns, the Central Research Institute for Jute and Allied Fibres (CRIJAF) under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has developed a model retting tank with slow moving water. “We have the technology, but it needs promotion and adaptation,” Gouranga Kar, director, CRIJAF, said.

Bangladesh also does well in exports because it has three to four different kinds of subsidies. For instance, it gives 9-10 per cent export subsidy for food-grade packing bags, which is much higher than India’s 1.5-3 per cent subsidy.

Another reason for the country’s success is its capturing of the diversified jute products market, for which there is a huge international demand. India’s major jute exports, in contrast, are sacking and hessian bags.

Moloy Chakraborty, the Jute Commissioner of India, pointed out that diversifying into other products can open new avenues for the sector and reduce its dependence on the government. “Being environmental friendly, jute has a huge potential in the diversified goods market, especially in regions and nations that have banned plastic,” he said.

High-end fashion brands are also coming out with more jute products such as sandals. With India’s high production, it should be in a position to capture this market. “Some 85 per cent of our jute is consumed domestically, while 15 per cent is exported. The situation is reverse for Bangladesh,” Kar said.

“Diversification is key if India wants to make the jute market successful. Demand for diversified products has to be created even domestically. This can be a big boost for a plastic-free India as well,” he added.

Currently, 92 per cent of the total domestic jute produced is used for packaging purposes and just eight per cent is for other products, according to the Office of the Jute Commissioner.

Why, then, are jute mills not focusing on product diversification? JPMA ensures that the government purchases 70 per cent of the mills’ total production, Rishav Kajaria, deputy chairman, Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), said.

This should put the mills on a strong footing to capture diversified markets for the rest 30 per cent. However, only a handful of mills have the capacity to diversify.

Sorry state of mills

Jute mills are marred by issues of machinery modernisation, mismanagement, labour shortage and unrest and dependence on the government. Industry experts Down To Earth spoke to said of the 70 mills in West Bengal, only around 60 are currently operating.

At least 10 mills closed down between October 2021 and May 2022, after a state government decision to cap pricing of raw jute on September 30, 2021. The decision was opposed by the industry and revoked on May 19 this year.

Experts also said the decision led to massive losses. The Union government capped the price at which the jute mills can purchase raw jute at Rs 6,500 per quintal (1 quintal equals 0.1 tonne) and it based its purchases of jute bags on this cap. But the actual price borne by mills to buy raw jute was Rs 7,000-7,200 per quintal.

Of the 10 mills that closed down, three have not managed to open again, rendering around 60,000 workers unemployed.

Kajaria also said one of the reasons the business had not been profitable was inadequate and arbitrary pricing of jute bags by the government. This pricing is fixed on a formula derived by the tariff commission, under the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Currently, the bags are priced on the basis of the provisional rates of 2016, which were meant to last for just six months, till the commission came out with a new report. The report was finally submitted to the Union Ministry of Textiles in April 2021 and is pending implementation.

In the meantime, IJMA has been in a tussle with the Union textile ministry, demanding revision of prices. At the current prices, according to the association, the industry is making a minimum loss of Rs 3,000 per tonne by supplying jute bags to the government.

“Raw jute prices are increasing but the costs have not been updated,” Kajaria said. “The industry is in survival mode right now. Some 70 per cent of my market is not paying me fairly. We do not have a strong balance sheet to think about innovation,” he added.

“There are very few mills that can take themselves out of a bad economic situation,” Amlesh Mishra, president of Loomtex Engineering Private Limited in North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, said. He has been working in the jute industry for the last 37 years.

Experts said of the functioning mills, only 8-10 are in good financial health and can survive seasonal losses. The business of another 20 mills is just average. The rest of the mills are financially unsound.

At the Baranagar Jute Mill in Kolkata, for instance, workers complain that the operations have significantly reduced in the past few years and so have the wages of the employees.

“I get work for hardly 12 days a month now,” Ashok Kumar Das, who has been working at the mill for the last 20 years, said. Sushil Jaiswal, leader of the jute workers’ trade union, who has also worked at the Baranagar mill in the past, alleged that it is being converted into a warehouse.

“The machines are being dismantled,” he said. DP Bhatter, an official at the mill, agreed that they were running at only 50 per cent capacity, but blamed the pricing cap for the situation.

But even the mills that are doing well are marred by problems. Samir Kumar Chanda, director of Hukumchand Jute Mill, said to be Asia’s largest jute mill, in North 24 Parganas, said they were at least 2,000 labourers short.

“It has become difficult to find workers ready to work in a jute mill.” The company has recently adopted a new policy, under which its human resources manager goes to nearby villages to look for people interested in working in a jute mill and make them aware of the incentives and wages the mill is giving.

All is not lost, Chanda said. “Jute has a bright future. We need to create a demand for diversified products and modernise,” he said.

For modernisation of the jute mills, the Union government is implementing the Incentive Scheme for Acquisition of Plant & Machinery, under which capital subsidy is being provided to replace the old machines.

However, mill officials said the subsidy had been stopped since last two years. Chakroborty confirmed that the scheme had been stopped, but only temporarily, since a new version of the scheme for the whole of textile industry was in the works.

796738,Minimum support price: Centre forms panel to consider legal guarantee,"Committee to look into zero-budget farming, cropping pattern

A 29-member committee will look into providing legal guarantee for minimum support price (MSP) for agricultural produce, the Narendra Modi government announced July 18 — days ahead of a “protest against betrayal” planned by the Samyukt Kisan Mocha (SKM) collective.

Prime Minister Modi had promised to form such a panel in November 2021 while repealing his three contentious farm laws after farmers blocked several key connections to national capital Delhi for a year. Legal guarantee for MSP was among the core demands of the protesting farmers.

The new committee will be chaired by former Union agriculture secretary Sanjay Agarwal and will include:

NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand

Three representatives of SKM

Five members of other farmer organisations

Two representatives of farmers’ cooperatives

National award winning farmer Bharat Bhushan Tyagi

Agriculture economists Sukhpal Singh and CSC Shekhar

A member of Commission of Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP)

Three representatives of agricultural universities

Five officials from different central ministries

Agriculture joint secretary (Crops)

Four representatives of state governments of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, and Odisha

Accordign to the July 18 government notification, the committee was to give:

Suggestions to make available MSP to farmers of the country by making the system more effective and transparent, suggestions on practicality to give more autonomy to Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and measures to make it more scientific.

The panel will strengthen the agricultural marketing system “as per the changing requirements of the country to ensure higher value to the farmers through remunerative prices of their produce by taking advantage of the domestic and export opportunities”, the government paper added.

However, it doesn’t mention if making MSP a legal guarantee is on the committee’s agenda or not, which was what the protesting farmers wanted to have a discussion on.

SKM, an umbrella body of 40 farmers’ unions at the forefront of the year-long protests, had called for protests in 500 districts on July 31 for the pending demand. Opposition Congress too had hit out at the government.

The committee will also look into two other issues of zero budget based farming and “to change crop pattern keeping in mind the changing needs of the country.” The committee will suggest farmer friendly alternative certification system and marketing system for natural farming processes and products.

It will also map existing cropping patterns of agro-ecological zones of producer and consumer states and develop a strategy for diversification policy to change the cropping pattern “according to the changing needs of the country.”",0
796741,Vegetable prices soar in Chandigarh; likely to come down in the coming days,"Rains have affected a variety of crops including green chillies, limiting their supply and ultimately resulting in increased prices. (Picture credits: Pixabay/Representational)

Due to recent rainfall which led to the damage of crops, the prices of vegetables have increased and are on an upswing across apni mandis in Chandigarh.

Rains have affected a variety of crops including green chillies, limiting their supply and ultimately resulting in increased prices.

Increase in vegetable prices

According to a report published in the Hindustan Times (HT), several vegetables have seen a hike in prices by Rs 5 to 10 per kg.

On February 7, green chillies were sold for Rs 60 per kg against Rs 50 three weeks back.

Considered a staple in Indian food, onion prices have also increased from Rs 35 to Rs 40 in the past three weeks.

However, to consumers’ slight relief, the prices of potato and tomato remained unchanged at Rs 15 and Rs 40 per kg respectively.

Along with this, rain spells have also led to a rise in prices of cauliflower, from Rs 40 to Rs 50.

Vegetable prices expected to come down

As per reports by HT, Harpreet Singh, mandi supervisor with the Punjab Mandi Board, said that though January's light rain is considered good for the crops, heavy rain and fast winds can lead to damage.

Other than this, high transportation charges have led to an increase in onion prices.

Though vegetables are retailing at high prices, mandi officials are expecting that the prices may come down in the coming days, owing to better weather conditions.

796815,"‘Rubber Bill 2022 makes Rubber Board redundant, doesn’t ensure fair price’","James Jacob, former director of the Rubber Research Institute of India, talks to Down To Earth on the proposed amendments

The Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry has proposed to repeal the Rubber Act, 1947 and replace it with the Rubber (Promotion and Development) Bill, 2022.

Removal of ‘archaic provisions’ to create an environment for ‘easy conduct of business’ and to reorient the functions of the Rubber Board were cited by the commerce department as the reasons for introducing a ‘modern legislature’.

Shuchita Jha from Down To Earth talked to James Jacob, the former director of the Rubber Research Institute of India, Rubber Board, on key changes and how they will impact the rubber growers of the country.

Shuchita Jha: How is the Bill different from the Rubber Act of 1947?

James Jacob: The Bill brings natural rubber, its cultivation, rubber plantations, rubber wood and all associated agricultural activities under the ambit of the rubber industry. This is a major change from the Act which did not define rubber cultivation as an industrial activity.

Rubber plantations will be under the Union or Concurrent List by default once the Bill is passed.

One cannot be sure if this was the intention but the possibility is real. It may still require a constitutional amendment. One thing is clear: Once adopted by the Parliament, this provision will have important constitutional implications.

The Act had a provision that mandated the central government to consult the Rubber Board on important matters. This provision has been dropped, eroding the board’s functional relevance and authority.

SJ: What will be the implication of the Rubber Boards’ reduced advisory role? Does the bill propose changes to the composition of the Rubber Board?

JJ: The Bill gives the central government authority to supersede the Rubber Board. The central government can take its own decisions without consulting the Rubber Board and implement them through any person(s) (industry) it wants.

The central government can exempt any industry from having to register with the Rubber Board and seeking a trade certificate. The exempted industry doesn't have to file returns with the board.

This will create anarchy as the board will have no clue of the vital statistics. Possibly this route will also be used for importing rubber.

While reconstituting a fresh board (at the end of the superseding period), the Bill says the Centre can pick and choose members from the previous board. It states that members of the previous board will be eligible to become members.

But the government can conveniently avoid inconvenient members. The Bill gives unbridled power to the Centre.

The Rubber Board will become a mere rubber stamp. No more free and fair debates of new ideas. Board will have to toe the “official” line. No functional autonomy. This defeats the whole purpose of having a Board.

SJ: The bill has defined rubber plants, estates, production and wood as rubber industry. What are the consequences of this?

JJ: Declaring rubber cultivation as an industry has many domestic legal implications. For example, if the rubber plantation is not considered by the courts as agricultural land there can be very far-reaching implications for bank loans, pledging and other.

By explicitly defining rubber cultivation as an industrial activity, the government is once and for all closing the doors of renegotiating with the WTO to make rubber an agricultural product. This would have been the best deal for rubber growers (but not necessarily for the industry).

Once the Bill is passed, by default the rubber plantations will come under the Union or Concurrent List.

SJ: Can you throw some light on the quality standards mentioned for produced and imported rubber?

JJ: The Bill said ‘quality standards will be “implemented” for all rubber produced in India and imported to India’. But it also adds that ‘quality standards will be “enforced” for rubber produced in India’, not for imported rubber.

Is this contradiction / confusion inadvertent is the question many are asking. Making confusing and apparently contradictory provisions will only help those who want to fish in troubled waters. One wonders whether due care and diligence have been taken to draft the proposed Bill.

“The question of quality of imported rubber should be seen in the context of the huge pressure from very high levels on the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and the Rubber Board to agree to import low-quality cup lumps.

The lumps are a form of unprocessed, often decaying natural rubber of uncertain quality. The above “provision” will make it easy to import poor quality, cheap rubber.

Imports will be essential if we do not produce enough rubber in the country. Alternatively, there will be more consumption of synthetic rubbers, because the country needs to consume more rubber and the rubber industry is a significant driver of the national economy.

Demand for rubber will more than double in the next decade and triple by 2040. Domestic rubber production was almost enough to meet the demand until about 10 years ago. Now, rubber deficit is more than 45 per cent and this is bound to go up in the years ahead (even as unproductive old / senile plantations are not getting replanted). The Bill does not provide a framework for timely replanting of plantations once they cross their economic life.

SJ: Does the Bill protect the interests of the growers?

JJ: The new Bill states that equal focus will be given to rubber production and industry, but the truth, as evident from the provisions of the Bill, is that the Bill is highly lopsided, favouring the industry and harming growers’ interests.

Though the Bill defines a ‘grower’ as one who owns the estate, it is not the case. The mean size of a rubber holding is hardly 0.5 hectare. Rubber growers are small and marginal farmers, and safeguarding their interests is crucial to sustaining rubber production in the country. Natural rubber cultivation gives livelihood to more than 1.3 million households.

There is nothing in the Bill that will help the grower, but there are several provisions that will hurt them. The Bill provides for fixing minimum / maximum price for rubber. The grower does not need a minimum price, but a fair price. The Bill does not provide for fixing fair price.

Also, if and when the domestic market falls below the fair price, the Rubber Board should be allowed to buy and export rubber to provide relief for growers. The Act had a provision enabling the Rubber Board to procure rubber and export, but this provision has been removed in the Bill. Fixing the maximum price will only help the industry, not the grower.",0
797182,Why tomato prices are increasing in Hyderabad,"Reportedly, supermarkets and retailers are selling tomatoes at prices ranging from Rs 60 to Rs 110 per kg. (Representational Image)

After onions, tomato prices have taken the top place on the vegetable price list in Hyderabad. The prices of tomatoes have been constantly rising in the city for the past couple of weeks. Prices are expected to remain on the higher side till mid-June.

Several shops and retailers are selling tomatoes at rates ranging from around Rs 60 to Rs 110 per kg. But why is there a sudden rise in tomato rates? Let's find out.

REASONS BEHIND PRICE HIKE

Due to soaring heat and unexpected increase in fuel rates, tomato prices have hiked in the city. Amid the severe heat conditions, farmers are unable to supply an adequate amount of crops.

Torrid summer days are damaging the crops, making the tomato supply tighter in the city.

ALSO READ | It's hot! Ahmedabad sizzles at 43.5 degrees Celsius, slight relief likely on weekend

Hence, the tomatoes are reportedly being supplied from different states such as Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, making it even costlier for the customers.

Since 70 per cent of the tomatoes are being supplied from other states, the traders have to pay heavy transportation charges, leading to the rise in prices.

Earlier this month, tomato prices reached Rs 50 per kg, against Rs 10 a kg a month ago.

In other news, tomato prices have also hiked in Delhi amid the heatwave. The tomato rates are nearly 400 per cent higher than in previous years, according to the wholesale and retail vegetable sellers. It is being sold at Rs 65-80 per kg this year, by retailers.",0

With the rise in the rates of fuel across the country, fish prices too increased in Kolkata. The prices of fruit, vegetables and meat have been increasing.

Households in the city are being forced to cut down the food budget as the prices of food essentials have jumped in the market, including the rates of fish.

Fish prices remained on the higher side across the retail markets of Kolkata on Thursday.

REVISED FISH RATES

The price of fish such as Katla and Rahu has increased by Rs 50 per Kg. Meanwhile, in Shyambazar Market where Katla Fish was being sold at Rs 180-200 last week, it has now jumped to Rs 250 per Kg.

Similarly, the Pabda fish retailed at Rs 360 a kg yesterday, while the Bhetki fish retailed at 500 per kg, which was sold at Rs 400 last week.

Talking to India today, one of the businessmen in the market named Shyambazar Raju Rah said that the price of every fish has been increased by Rs 50 as most of them come from the markets outside the borders.

Somnath Bhattacharay, a buyer who was looking for some local fish at a cheap rate said, ""I have stopped buying fish every day now. In my family, we are having fish once or twice a week.""

Tackling the hike on consumer goods across the state, yesterday, Mamata Banerjee announced that the West Bengal government will sell fruits and vegetables at subsidized rates through its 332 'Sufal Bangla' retail outlets.

On Thursday announcing measures aimed at tackling the hike in prices of consumer goods, Mamata Banerjee announced that the West Bengal government will sell fruits and vegetables at subsidized rates through its 332 'Sufal Bangla' retail outlets.

797722,Staple spikes: Has an abnormal Kharif 2022 caused rice prices to rise,"The United States Department of Agriculture has said rice production in India may decline by 0.9% in 2022-23 due to uneven rains

Rice prices are spiking across India, even in areas where it is the staple. This development comes even as the country has experienced an abnormal Kharif season, with uneven distribution of rainfall.

The cereal that forms the staple diet of over half of India’s population has become prohibitively expensive even in the country’s rice belt. For example, rice is being sold at Rs 58 per kilogram in Chennai and Rs 41 per kg in Kolkata.

The wholesale price of rice has increased by four per cent during the last one month. The price of rice has increased by 7.3 per cent, compared to last year.

The retail price of rice was Rs 37.94 per kg as on August 17, 2022, according to the Price Monitoring Cell of the Department of Consumer Affairs. The wholesale price of rice was Rs 3,295.24 per quintal.

The retail price was Rs 36.6 per kg and the wholesale price was Rs 3,167.18 per kg July 17, 2022. This means the retail price has increased by 3.09 per cent and the wholesale price by 4.04 per cent in a month.

The retail price of rice was Rs 35.61 per kg August 17 last year, which increased to Rs 37.73 (5.95 per cent higher) this year. The wholesale price has increased to Rs 3,295.26 per quintal from Rs 3,068.95 per quintal last year (7.37 per cent higher).

Bad Kharif

The abnormal distribution of rains in the current monsoon season has caused significant damage to the paddy crop.

Paddy had been sown on 30.98 million hectares (mha) as on August 12, 2022, according to Union agriculture ministry data. This figure was 35.36 mha at the same time last year.

Paddy has not been sown on 4.383 mha (12.40 per cent less) this year, as compared to last year. The total area under paddy in the country is about 39.7 mha.

That is, 90 per cent of the paddy had been sown by the second week of August last year. But this year, only about 70 per cent sowing has been done.

The most affected state is Jharkhand. Here, paddy was sown on 1.525 mha in 2021. But this year, only 0.3885 mha has been sown.

Similarly, paddy was sown on 3.027 mha in Bihar last year. But this year, it has been sown on 2.627 mha.

West Bengal has sown paddy on 2.43 mha this year, against 3.55 mha last year, Odisha 2.0368 mha against 2.468 mha, Uttar Pradesh 5.6930 mha against 5.892 mha and Madhya Pradesh 2.5480 mha against 2.994 mha.

Of course, no estimate has been issued by the Government of India about rice production so far. But the forecasts released by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) August 16, 2022 are shocking.

The USDA has said rice production in India may decline by 0.9 per cent in 2022-23. This will reduce production for the first time after 2015-16.

According to the USDA, India is expected to produce 128.5 million tonnes of rice in 2022-23. There was a record production of 132.9 million tonnes of rice in 2021-22.

The USDA attributed the decline in rice production to the uneven distribution of the southwest monsoon.

However, the USDA said India would still be able to export rice since its production in other countries would also be less. The USDA has estimated the total consumption of rice in India at 108.4 million tonnes.

Rice stocks in India are usually enough as far as production vis-a-vis consumption is concerned. But this is possible only when the government keeps a close watch on the export of rice.

A similar problem happened in the case of wheat as well this year. While wheat production was decreasing, India was exporting wheat in large quantities to take advantage of the situation created by the Russia-Ukraine war.

Later, the government had to ban the export of wheat.",0
797983,Doubling Farmers Income: Complete Guide & Action Plan for Farmers to Increase Their Income,"Doubling Farmers Income has been a topic of discussion for quite some time now. Farmers who play a vital role in the Indian economy are mostly not aware of this Central Government strategy of doubling farmer’s income by the financial year 2022-23. In this guide, we will explain to you what is Doubling Farmers Income, Why it is important, How can we double the income of farmers, and much more beneficial information for our farmers.

What is Doubling Farmers Income?

In simple words, Doubling Farmers Income is a central government strategy to help the farmers by doubling their income by 2022-23. The plan has recognized the need to raise farmer’s income as a direct measure to promote farmers' welfare. Doubling Farmers Income can directly have a positive effect on the future of agriculture.

Why Doubling Farmers Income is important?

If the income earned by the farmer is doubled then he/she will use better farm machinery, better and advanced technologies for farming to increase productivity, better quality of seeds, etc. Therefore, increasing farmer’s income means increasing agricultural productivity. Doubling Farmers Income will not only increase agriculture production by using better farming techniques but also improve the quality of crops. Both the quantity and quality of food can be achieved by Doubling Farmers Income. It will lead to the growth of the Indian economy. Incident of farmer’s suicide will come to an end if farmers are financially satisfied.

How can we double the income of farmers?

Strong measures are required to fulfill the aim of doubling the income of farmers.

The following measure can be taken within the agriculture sector to double farmer’s income:

Improvement in productivity

Saving in cost of production

Cropping intensity must be increased

There must be diversification towards high-value crops

Action plan to double farmers income outside the agriculture sector include:

Plan to shift cultivators from farm to non-farm occupations

There must be an improvement in terms of trade for farmers or real prices received by farmers

What is the Strategy for Improving Farmers Income?

Farmers must adopt these strategies to improve their income

Development initiatives like infrastructure

Better Technology

Awareness and implementation of Policies

Institutional mechanisms

798685,"Farmers’ agitation sees nearly Rs 600-crore loss in toll collections in states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR; Rs. 9300-crore of debt at risk: ICRA","Share this

29 January 2021, New Delhi: ICRA Ratings has said that around 52 toll plazas [includes both public funded and BOT (built, operate and transfer)] for national highways (NHs) operated in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR have been directly or indirectly affected due to farmers protests. Apart from this, the revenue loss in the State Highways Projects in these regions will be an additional burden. On September 27, 2020, the three Farm Acts† were passed in the Parliament. These acts have been facing strong protests from the farmers of Haryana and Punjab since June 2020 and have intensified from October 1, 2020 onwards, with rail and road network obstructed majorly in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR.

Also Read: Rural demand seen ebbing in 2021-22, but urban consumption to rise: Report

While the impact on fee collection at some of the toll plazas has begun from October 2020 onwards; however, this has intensified to no fee collection (free movement of vehicles) at all toll plazas in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi-NCR since December 12, 2020. Shedding more light on the impact on toll collections, Mr. Rajeshwar Burla, Vice President, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said, “The average toll collection per day at these plazas is estimated at Rs. 7 crore. Until January 26, 2021, these national highway toll plazas would have incurred an estimated revenue loss of around Rs. 560 crore out of which ~Rs. 410 crore is estimated for BOT Concessionaires. Out of the Rs. 9,300-crore of impacted rated debt, ~Rs. 8550-crore of debt is at a high risk of default while Rs. 750 crore is rated as investment grade with low to moderate risk of default. Some of these entities also have debt service reserves (DSRAs) of around three months in place to use for such exigencies; however, this would have been completely used up by now.”

The inability to collect toll for a continuous period of 24 hours and exceeding an aggregate period of seven days in an accounting year due to agitations/ strikes would be considered an indirect political event under the force majeure clause. In such cases, with the costs attributable to such events, beyond the insurance cover, one half of such excess amount is likely to be reimbursed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), covering around 25% of the loss of revenue incurred by the affected projects. As per ICRA estimates, this would amount to around Rs.100 crore until January 26, 2021. Further, the concession period shall be extended in proportion to the loss of fee on a daily basis.

As for the impact on the ratings for ICRA-rated BOT (Toll) road portfolio, three entities have been impacted by the farmer protests, out of which two had been rated in the default category even before the farm protests, while the third (rated [ICRA]BBB-(Stable)) has support from a stronger parent. “The performance of toll road projects has remained subpar in Q1 FY2021 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the toll collections witnessed a marked improvement starting Q2 FY2021; with this farmer agitation, the toll road projects in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR region are expected to be impacted severely, resulting in a steep decline of around 30-35% in toll collections in FY2021 (when compared to 5-7% decline for rest of India), assuming that the protests would subside by February 2021,”",0

If we the look HIL (India) Limited’s performance during the first two quarters, it has recorded incredible growth of 65 percent”. The company has manufactured 530.10 MT of Malathion Technical in the first two quarters as compared to 375.5 MT in the corresponding period last year (CPLY), which is the highest ever production since its inception, he added.

In addition to this, the company has also registered the highest ever sale for the product in the first two quarters and supplied the entire quantity to various institutions like the Ministry of Agriculture’s Locust Control Programme and municipal corporations across the country for the vector control.",0
798751,High fertiliser prices shock farmers even as ministry denies shortage reports,"Farmers in different states have protested against unavailability of fertilisers

Global rise in fertiliser prices due to shortage has dealt a severe blow to farmers across India, which is the second-largest importer of fertilisers. Many states have seen cultivators erupting in protest, even as the Centre dismissed news of low availability of fertilisers.

Dattaraye P Darekar from Vinchur village in Maharashtra is worried about his soybean and maize crops sown over four hectares (ha). Shopkeepers in his village have been talking of a fertiliser shortage.

“They are telling us (farmers) that in the next 15 days, there will be a shortage of urea and sulphate, and that the prices will increase further. That is the time when I will need these fertilisers for my crops,” he said.

He doesn’t have the money to purchase in advance and stock fertilisers, he said, and is waiting to make money from selling his onion crops first.

Fertiliser prices have risen nearly 30 per cent since the beginning of 2022, following last year’s 80 per cent surge. The rise was driven by factors like surging input costs, supply disruptions due to sanctions (Belarus and Russia) as well as export restrictions in China.

Darekar usually applies both sulphate and urea to his soyabean crops, he said, adding that this time, it seems like he won’t be left with urea. “I will instead use urea for the maize crop.”

The farmer is worried over the rocketing prices. The maximum retail price for a 50 kilogram bag of urea has been Rs 268 since 2018, according to experts. The difference between the farmer price and the cost of production of urea is borne by the government as a subsidy.

“The shopkeepers are saying the price will go up to Rs 400 for a 50kg bag of urea,” Darekar shared.

Some 500 km away in Adilabad district, cotton farmers have been facing a shortage of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) as well as nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK) fertilisers. They have reported to have been travelling to nearby districts of Maharashtra to procure these products. Cotton requires fertiliser application thrice during a crop cycle.

In Telangana’s Nagireddypally village, local farmer M Vittal said there has been a shortage of DAP for the last 15 days. He was able to buy DAP for his 2.4 ha cotton crop only on June 27 at Rs 1,000 more than the usual price.

Global price hike

The international prices of DAP have increased by about 65.66 per cent from $565 (Rs 44,645) per tonne in May, 2021 to $936 per tonne in May, 2022, according to the Centre’s monthly bulletin for May.

Urea prices have increased by about 94.09 per cent from $372 per tonne in May, 2021 to $722 per tonne in May, 2022. Urea production is based on natural gas, prices of which are closely related to international oil prices.

Sulphur prices have increased by about 138.8 per cent from $216 per tonne in May, 2021 to $516 per tonne in May, 2022.

The Union Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilisers has been maintaining that there is no shortage of fertilisers but different parts of the country have been reporting shortage.

A shortage in Karnataka’s Kodagu and Dharwad districts has affected agricultural activities at the time of sowing in June, according to media reports. There have been protests by farmers in different states, including Andhra Pradesh and Manipur, against the unavailability of fertilisers.

On June 27, 30 organisations, including the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), Kisan Swaraj, Jai Kisan Andolan, farmers’ federations and collectives as well as dozens of other individuals, including farmers, have sent an open letter to the Union minister and secretaries of agriculture and farmers’ welfare ministries as well as chemicals and fertilisers about the on-going fertiliser crisis.

The letter claimed that there is a serious availability crisis and, as a consequence, prices have shot up for many synthetic fertilisers, as Kharif season begins.

They experienced the crisis to an extent during the Rabi season of 2021-22 also, but the Russia-Ukraine war, which erupted after, made the situation worse.

For Kharif 2022, there is a requirement of 35.4 million tonnes (MT), of which 17.9 MT is urea, 5.8 MT is DAP, 6.3 MT is NPK, 1.9 MT is muriate of potash and 3.3 MT is single super phosphate. The closing stock on June 9, 2022 was 6.6 MT, 1.9 MT, 2.2 MT, .4 MT and 1.7 MT respectively.

Sales of urea, DAP and NPK made till June 9, 2022 were 3.9 MT, 1.2 MT and .8 MT respectively.

However, the stocks as of June are a little over their estimated requirement for the month, but T Sreeharsha from Rythu Swarjya Vedika, a non-profit working with farmers in Telangana, said that farmers are facing shortages also due to lack of proper rationing and distribution.

Dubious policy

Apart from being the second-largest importer of fertilisers, India imports raw materials for domestic production such as natural gas to make urea and phosphoric acid to make DAP.

Fertiliser stocks have been declining for the past two years. The stock in September 2021 was 6.9 MT, for instance, compared to 2.5 MT in September 2018.

There is a policy uncertainty that the fertiliser industry is facing, experts said. “There is a lack of long-term clarity on the quantum of non-urea fertiliser subsidies and, as a result, fertiliser companies are unable to make long-term plans on production, imports and stocks,” the farmer organisations said in the letter.

The government has been taking ad-hoc short-term decisions on fertiliser subsidy season-wise, and even these decisions are not taken adequately in advance to allow the industry to forecast and plan sufficiently ahead, it added.

In efforts to control price rise, the government increased the nutrient-based subsidy rate for Kharif 2022.

The Centre’s fertiliser subsidy expenditure is likely to be in the range of Rs 2.10-2.30 lakh crore in the current financial year, the letter mentioned.

The budget estimate for the financial year 2022-23 was only Rs 1.05 lakh crore. This will be the highest ever expenditure on fertiliser subsidy by a wide margin, the experts added.",0
798752,Stubble burning amid rising fodder prices: Why the paradox,"Farmers say the window to sow paddy after harvesting wheat was reduced

A strange paradox emerged in the primary economic sector in India recently: A section of farmers, especially in Punjab, burnt the residue after harvesting their wheat even as fodder prices shot up.

Wheat yield has been relatively low this year, anyway, and the stubble could have supplemented farmers’ income. Yet, they decided to set their fields on fire. Why?

Several farmers told Down To Earth that they took to burning stubble as they were in a hurry — the state had set June 10 as the date to sow paddy.

Fodder in Punjab is known as ‘tudi’ and is made from wheat stubble. The tudi rate in the state was Rs 950-Rs 1,100 per quintal before the wheat harvest in April. This changed to Rs 400-Rs 800 per quintal in different parts of the state after the harvest.

Read

Farmers burnt wheat stubble despite these high prices. The Punjab Remote Sensing Centre, Ludhiana, recorded 11,650 cases of stubble burning till May 29 this year, against 11,468 last year.

Dyant Singh, a 46 year-old farmer from Kathar village in Jalandhar district, told this writer that burning the wheat stubble was the easiest way to get rid of it. He was in a hurry to do so since the Punjab government had declared June 10 as the date to sow paddy.

“Other processes such as flooding the field to make the stubble softer and then ploughing it, is time-consuming. Either you waste a lot of water or contaminate a little air. It’s a trade-off that we have to make,” Singh said.

The date for planting paddy has been brought forward to conserve water in Punjab. The window between the harvesting of wheat and sowing of paddy shrank with the enactment of the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act, 2009.

The Act suggests that for conserving groundwater, transplanting of paddy has to be done by June 10, when the most severe phase of evapo-transpiration is over.

Another reason for farmers burning wheat stubble in Punjab is the size of land holdings. The average land holding in the state is 3.62 hectares (ha), according to government data.

Increasingly, marginal, small and medium land holders, owning less than four ha of land are either selling out or mostly renting their farms to large farmers who can afford capital-intensive agriculture including costly machines.

A farmer generally gets two trollies of fodder — approximately 16-17 quintals — per acre. For getting the same fodder, a farmer has to pay Rs 1,200 per trolley to the fodder maker, who uses his machinery and tractor to convert stubble into fodder.

The farmer will be able to sell fodder for Rs 16,000-17,000 per acre at the rate of Rs 1,000- 1,100 per quintal.

The farmer can earn around Rs 13,600-14,600 from an acre of the farm after paying the fodder maker. Those small holding farmers who can’t afford to sell / rent their land, have found that an easy alternative for managing the crop stubble is to burn it. Hence, the fires.

The Punjab government has, nevertheless distributed 76,622 machines to farmers and custom hiring centres on a subsidy of Rs 1,000 crore from the Union government since 2018.

These machines only do well in extracting the stalk, but not the upper part of the roots which are left untouched. The government has also started giving farmers Rs 1,500 as an incentive for not burning the leftover stubble for a farm of one kanal or 0.05 hectares.

However, there were small and medium farmers who told this writer that they found no reason to burn the stubble. Rather, they ploughed it, which proved advantageous.

Purushottam, a farmer with a medium-sized farm, also in Kathar, said, “I have been doing this for the past decade. I have seen good changes in the farm. Although, it is very easy to burn stubble, it harms the top soil, which hard like a brick. Try walking over that patch.”

He also found it strange that farmers who did not abide by the government’s laws regarding not burning stubble, adhered to rules about sowing paddy quickly.

“I have ample time to sow paddy. Also, ploughing the farm frequently after harvesting wheat makes the soil very suitable for paddy and also doesn’t pollute the air. I have also seen the amount of fertiliser reduce in the soil in the last decade,” Purushottam said.",0
798764,Centre rolls back decision to cap price of raw jute,"The decision had faced strong opposition from the jute industry, especially in West Bengal, where around ten jute mills closed down and 60,000 workers were affected

The Union Ministry of Textiles withdrew its notification of September 2021 about capping the price of raw jute to Rs 6,500 per quintal May 19, 2022, in a relief to jute mills.

The decision came a week after the jute commissioner was told by the Calcutta High Court to take steps to review the rate of raw jute if the notified rate (Rs 6,500 per quintal) cannot be adhered to.

The court was hearing a petition filed by the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA), which said the decision had led to massive losses for mills.

The government decision to cap the price to Rs 6,500 per quintal was issued September 30, 2021. It has faced strong opposition from the jute industry since then, especially in West Bengal, where around ten jute mills have closed down and 60,000 workers have been affected since the decision.

Jute Commissioner Moloy Chandan Chakrabortty said in the ministry’s order issued May 19:

After careful analysis and considering the present market scenario of raw jute availability, I hereby withdraw the said notification.

The withdrawal will come into effect from May 20.

According to IJMA, the September notification had caused a loss over Rs 300 crore to the industry since September. This was because while the government capped the price at which the jute mills can purchase raw jute at Rs 6,500 per quintal, the actual price borne by the jute mills was somewhere between Rs 7,000-7,200 per quintal.

Additionally, the government was pricing the jute bags it purchases from the mills based on the Rs 6,500 per quintal cap.

“One jute bag was Rs 62-65 according to the government’s pricing. Due to this, the mills lost close to Rs 3 per bag,” Raghavendra Gupta, chairman, IJMA told Down To Earth.

“In the market, the jute was never made available below Rs 7,200. So the industry had to keep buying jute at a higher price and make jute bags for the government, which paid according to Rs 6,500 pricing.

“Mills, in order to keep the operations running, were forced to purchase jute at those higher prices otherwise more mills would have been shut,” he added.

Most of the jute business for the mills consists of supplying jute bags to the government. “It’s a very welcome step. Market forces will be allowed to function normally. Any regulation in commodity trade is unwarranted. Business should get back to normal going forward,” Gupta said, after the government notification May 19.",0
798768,"Wheat prices going strong in Madhya Pradesh, courtesy Ukraine, loss of yield in north India","Private traders are offering much higher prices than government MSP of Rs 2,015 per quintal

Wheat farmers in Madhya Pradesh continue to claim higher prices on their produce, even a month into the procurement season, amid concerns of global wheat shortage due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Farmers in the state are getting anywhere between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,400 per quintal from private traders and the prices are expected to rise further in the coming weeks. Some varieties of wheat are even selling for Rs 2,500 per quintal.

The prices are much higher than the government’s minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 2,015 per quintal.

The procurement season usually starts by the second week of April and most of the purchase is over by this time (mid-May). But this year, the procurement is still going strong as farmers are bringing their produce in instalments, in the hope of a gradual increase in prices.

“According to current trends, the prices are increasing every week, sometimes even within two or three days; by Rs 50-60 per quintal. Last week, the prices were around Rs 2,290 and today, farmers are getting up to Rs 2,350 per quintal,” Jitender Gupta, a trader at Dabra mandi in Gwalior, said.

The mandi or wholesale market sees the footfall of farmers from at least three nearby districts and also some adjoining areas of Uttar Pradesh.

Farmers here said procurement was almost over this time last year. But farmers are keeping a close watch this year, given the high wheat prices in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine crisis and are waiting for the right time to sell their harvest.

Most farmers Down To Earth spoke to at two mandis in Gwalior district said they had stocked at least half to one-fourth of their wheat harvest in anticipation of a continuous increase in prices.

For example, Gabbar Singh Jaat, a farmer from Urwa village in Gwalior, came to the Dabra mandi for the first time May 12 to sell just two-fifths of his crop.

“Last year, I had sold my entire crop to the government by this time. But this year, I have been waiting for a good price,” he said.

Jaat brought 80 quintals of his total harvest of 230 quintals of the high yielding ‘Raj 4120’ variety to Dabra mandi May 12 and got Rs 2,345 per quintal. The open auction for his crop started at Rs 2,280 and was finally sold at Rs 2,345 per quintal.

“Around 10 days ago, the price was Rs 2,250 per quintal and I knew it would increase. I will sell the remaining 150 quintals in the coming days,” he said. The wheat variety is also exported to other countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Oman.

Madhya Pradesh is one of the biggest exporters of wheat in India. Demand for wheat varieties like Sharbati and Kathia (durum), which are grown exclusively in the state, has risen in the international market after the ongoing crisis.

Prices in Madhya Pradesh are also high due to the loss of yield in the wheat crop of Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Birendra Pal, a farmer at Murar mandi in Gwalior, had sold just 25 quintals of his 200 quintal harvest till May 9 at Rs 2,280 per quintal.

Farmers and traders, both said the private procurement will continue for another month. “There is still a lot of crop which is yet to come to the market. The procurement will go strong and the prices will increase further,” Ashish Patel, a wheat trader at Murar mandi, said.

Government procurement, like in Punjab and Haryana, has fallen sharply since the MSP is much lower than the price offered by private traders. Officials at Dabra mandi said all of the 11 lakh tonnes of wheat sold at the mandi till May 12 had been procured by private traders.

Government agencies had procured 3.4 million tonnes of wheat in Madhya Pradesh under MSP operations, as on April 30, 2022. This was much less than the 12.8 million tonnes procured in the 2021-22 marketing season.",0
798798,Lucrative rabi: Mustard farmers may reap good prices despite bumper output,"Higher MSP, dearer imports expected to keep rates firm for local oilseeds

India looks set for a bumper mustard harvest this rabi season, which raises the question: Will those growing the oilseed reap enough compensation for their effort? Increased supply generally suppresses prices, but experts are optimistic that mustard farmers will duck that trend this time.

The country has already achieved its mustard acreage for 2025-26 this rabi season, according to the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The farmers are likely to fetch better prices this year despite record produce because of sustained demand and a substantial hike in minimum support price (MSP) for the crop.

Mustard has been sown on a record 9.1 million hectares (ha) for rabi season 2022-23, latest ministry data showed. This is a growth of 24.49 per cent from 2021-22, when the acreage was 7.3 million ha.

This surpassed the government’s own set projection of 9 million ha of mustard by 2025-26.

The overall acreage of oilseeds has increased by 22.09 per cent compared to the corresponding period last year, in which mustard has a major share.

The Centre has been trying to promote oilseeds production in the country. Before the beginning of this Rabi season, it announced a sharp MSP hike for mustard — the highest among all crops.

Mustard farmers this season will get Rs 5,050 per quintal, compared to Rs 4,650 per quintal last year. Even last year, farmers sold their produce at prices above MSP.

Shweta Saini, senior fellow with Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations who researches Indian agricultural policies, said:

Usually the price of a bumper crop falls but that seems unlikely with mustard this season. It can provide the substitution effect to some extent for palm oil, which has become exceptionally expensive as well as soybean, which is also expensive and the production is low this year.

Edible oils constitute about 47.5 per cent of India’s agricultural imports. In the last few years, improved domestic production hasn’t been able to meet the rising demand of edible oils in the country. This led to a steep rise in imports.

Around 60 per cent of the domestic demand for edible is met through imports, of which palm oil accounts for the highest (55.4 per cent).

Globally, there was a sharp increase in edible oil prices in 2021 and they are likely to remain high this year.

India’s import bill during the first nine months of the current fiscal (April-December 2021) surged by 75 per cent to Rs 1.04 lakh crore from Rs 59,543 crore during the corresponding period last year. And that is also one of the reasons the government has been encouraging more domestic oilseeds production.

Buoyant demand

Global inflationary pressure on edible oils will continue, Saini said.

Mustard is also likely to replace soybean in the poultry industry, as the production of the latter is affected. Around half the feed requirements in the sector are met by mustard, soybean or cotton.

The Union government's decision last year to ban blending of mustard oil with any other cooking oil will also boost the demand for mustard, said Devinder Sharma, food and agriculture policy analyst. “Additional mustard oil will be required to replace the oils which were being used for blending earlier.”

In a recent statement, the Central Organisation for Oil Industry and Trade (COOIT) had urged the government to create a buffer stock of mustard seeds of at least 2.5 million tonnes. This suggestion was aimed at ensuring oil processing units operate throughout the season.

“If the government creates a buffer stock of 2.5 million tonnes of mustard, it will further encourage mustard cultivation and also act as a price stabilisation mechanism in case of sharp fluctuations in mustard prices as it was witnessed during 2021,” COOIT chairperson Suresh Nagpal said.

Meanwhile, while area under mustard is continuously increasing — by an average of 5 million ha between 2014-15 and 2018-19 — the harvest targets are way off. The average production was 7.7 million tonnes during the same period and the government has set a target of 17 million tonnes by 2025-26. In 2020-21, production was 10.1 million tonnes.",0
798847,Turmeric soaps pave way for financial independence of Koraput’s tribal women,"Around 1,2000 tribal women in the area have managed to eke out a living making turmeric soaps

Soap bars made from turmeric roots, known for its antiseptic property, has helped the tribal women in Odisha’s Koraput district eke out a living.

Each year, around 1,000 tonnes of turmeric is harvested in hilly areas of the district that are conducive for the plant growth, according to an official of the Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS). Recently, the tribal population of the region has discovered a way of utilising the surplus produce.

They were provided grinding machines and training in soap crafting by the government-managed ORMAS and the Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Bhubaneswar.

“Around 1,200 tribal women are earning income by making turmeric soaps,” said Roshan Kumar Kartik, deputy chief executive, ORMAS.

“Our living condition has improved and we are now able to save Rs 4,000 a month,” said Kanti Miniaka of Konapadi village, who participated in training programmes organised by a self-help group run by 20 women.

The tribal people collect turmeric from the fields and ground them into fine powder. The powder is kneaded with almond oil in a heat-safe container and heated. The resulting mixture is cooled and shaped into moulds.

The herb is popular in the beauty industry for its purifying and anti-acne properties and thus, the soap has found many takers in urban areas like Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.

Each soap sells for Rs 50, added Kartik. “I made around Rs 3,000 per month in the last six months,” said Gita Muska of Tayaput village.

Muska had joined a self-help group in her locality where she was taught the art of making soaps from turmeric.",0
798877,"Petrol > Rs 100: Forget doubling income, farming now way costlier in Bihar","Ploughing turns expensive; price of seeds, fertilizers and insecticides increase as transportation costs rise

Spiralling prices of petroleum products has ushered in tough times for the farmers of Bihar: The cultivation process has turned costlier by almost 40 per cent.

The rise in petroleum prices has not only turned ploughing more expensive, but also increased the prices of seeds, fertilizers and insecticides because of a hike in transportation cost.

Petrol prices soared past Rs 100 a litre in all 38 districts of Bihar this farming season. Farmers are heavily dependent on petroleum products for farming. Electricity is not available in all fields.

This may threaten agricultural practices in Bihar, where 76 per cent population is engaged in agriculture works for livelihood.

“Agriculture has become a costly job for us with everything related to farming going costly due to rise in petroleum prices, but we have no option as such,” said Manoj Kumar, a farmer from East Champaran. The small and marginal farmers are more affected by the current development, he said.

According to him, a farmer is currently charged around Rs 80 for ploughing 1,361 square feet of land against Rs 30-40, which was the average cost last year.

“Farming is a compulsion, since there is no other option of earning livelihood in this landlocked state,” he said.

Kumar said earlier, the petroleum prices grew slowly. “The prices fluctuate a lot,” he added.

A farmer from Bihta block in Patna district Ram Prakash Singh said he paid Rs 6,000 for ploughing 10 bighas of agricultural land in 2020. “But this year, I had to pay Rs 8,000.”

He will have to pay the same amount, if not more, for irrigating his paddy seedlings once they are transplanted.

The trouble comes amid excess monsoon rainfall, destroying the paddy seedlings and maize plants in several districts of Bihar. Due to continuous rainfall, farmers have been facing problems in transplanting paddy seedlings or sowing maize seeds.

“The total paddy plantation accounts for 3.54 per cent of the total land area. Last year, it was 9.44 per cent during the same period,” said joint agriculture director (statistics), Shankar Kumar Chaudhary.

He said the sowing of maize has also been badly affected due to rainfall. “Only 29 per cent of maize could be sowed this year against 47 per cent last year,” said Chaudhary. He added that water-logging on farmlands was another area of concern.

The state recorded 137 per cent excess rains till June 28 this year compared to last year, leaving the farmland heavily waterlogged or flooded, according to a report of the agriculture department.

The state received 349.11 mm rainfall in June this year, according to a report of the agriculture department. The maximum rainfall of 647 mm was reported from West Champaran; the minimum of 188.2 mm was recorded in Purnia.

Such is the situation that quite many areas in some north Bihar districts such as West Champaran, Gopalganj and Muzaffarpur have faced flooding, prompting the villagers to flee homes.

“It’s double trouble for us. Excess rainfall has destroyed a quarter of paddy seedlings. We are sure to miss the farming season if we go sowing paddy seeds again,” said Sandeep Yadav, a farmer from Gopalganj district.

According to him, the timing for farming is different in north and south Bihar; farmers in north Bihar normally transplant paddy by July 15.

Yet, some farmers have been sowing paddy seeds again. Agriculture officials said the paddy transplantation works would pick up once the situation gets normal.

Bihar has a total geographical area of about 93.60 lakh hectares, out of which only 56.03 lakh hectares is the net cultivated area and 79.46 lakh hectares is the gross cultivated area, according to a report of agriculture department.

About 33.51 lakh hectares net area and 43.86 lakh hectares gross area receive irrigation from different sources. Principal food crops are paddy, wheat, maize and pulses. Main cash crops are sugarcane, potato, tobacco, oilseeds, onion, chillies and jute and. ‘’

Bihar has notified forest area of 6,764.14 sq km, which is 7.1 per cent of its geographical area.",1
798889,"Centre releases Rs 20,677 crore via PM-KISAN","West Bengal’s farmers among 95 million to get PM-KISAN instalment

The first instalment of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme for 2021-22 was released May 14, with Rs 20,667 crore being transferred to 95 million farmers, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar, said.

The instalment of Rs 2,000 for the period April-July was the first of the three instalments of the current financial year.

The eligible beneficiaries usually get their first instalment between March and April but it was delayed this time. The last instalment of Rs 2,000 was paid December 25, 2020.

PM-KISAN was launched in February 2019 to provide income support by way of cash benefit to all land-holding farmers to fulfill their agriculture requirements.

A financial benefit of Rs 6,000 per year is provided to the beneficiary farmers under PM-KISAN. It is payable in three equal instalments of Rs 2000 each.

This is the first time that farmers in West Bengal will also receive the cash transfer. This, after the West Bengal government approved the direct transfer and provided verified details of eligible farmers in the state in May.

The state had not accepted the scheme initially. During the transfer of the previous instalment, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said over 2.3 million farmers of Bengal had applied online to take advantage of this scheme. However, the state government had stopped the verification process.

Non-inclusion of West Bengal farmers is one of the reasons why the Centre has not been able to spend the entire allocated amount.

Some Rs 139,370.15 crore had been allocated to the scheme since February 2019, when the scheme was started. However, the government had been unable to spend Rs 23,727 crore of this amount, according to data submitted in Parliament in the Budget session earlier this year.

Till date, around 100 million farmer families have received a total of Rs 1.16 lakh crore in their bank accounts through PM-KISAN. Of this, Rs 60,000 crore was transferred during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic period.",0

The state has transferred Rs 21,010 crore as minimum support price (MSP) to farmers till May 10, 2021, state officials said. This means that it was able to pay 83 per cent of the Rs 25,280 crore owed to wheat farmers within one month, starting from April 10, when wheat procurement began in Punjab.

Punjab and Haryana were the only two states in the country which had not shifted to the DBT mode so far. While Haryana finally shifted last year in the Kharif marketing season, Punjab was reluctant this time too and had initially sought more time from the Central government.

Previously, payments to farmers were routed through aarthiyas or commission agents, according to the Punjab Agriculture Produce Market Rules. The money was routed to the aarthiyas’ bank accounts, who then used to pay the farmers.

But this system had also given way to exploitation of farmers through these middlemen. Hence, farmers and farmer unions had been demanding this shift. But now, when it has happened, there are several apprehensions among farmers as aarthiyas are not mere middlemen but assume the role of facilitators in various processes like auction of the produce, loading / unloading, and the most important being giving loans to farmers.

The amount paid by the government had reached the bank accounts of around 800,000 farmers, out of the total 950,000 registered with the state government, according to data given by the Punjab Food Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs department. Some Rs 40,000 crore will be routed through DBT by the end of this Rabi season, according to estimates with the state government.

‘Long overdue’

Experts said the shift to DBT was a step long overdue. In part, this was because of the aarthiyas, who according to them, were ‘exploiting’ farmers.

But why aarthiyas? Jasbir Singh, a farmer from Mithu Majra village in Patiala, said the answer lay in the fact that Punjab’s banking institutions had not able to meet the credit needs of farmers in the state.

About 59 per cent farmers had reported that the procedure to get loans from institutional agencies was complicated and time-consuming, according to a 2009 study published in Agricultural Economics Research Review. Farmers found availing non-institutional loans to be easy. It was preferred by 51 per cent of them.

Sukhpal Singh, professor, Centre for Management in Agriculture, Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad, said the gap in institutional credit was what the aarthiyas had exploited for long. They had turned moneylending into a full-time job, using the public procurement system.

He added:

They are using the procurement system to lend money. It is an implicit exploitation of farmers. The rate of interest charged by aarthiyas is somewhere around 15-18 per cent. Aarthiyas also overprice the farm inputs that they give on credit. When a farmer is buying on credit, he has no choice but to accept any price.

The rate of interest is 7-8 per cent for the institutional credit system.

Sukhpal Singh said:

Why lending loans should be tied to procurement? It should be irrespective of the public procurement system. There are independent ways of lending to farmers. The need of the hour is for the state government to strengthen the institutional credit systems in place.

This time though, the farmers registered themselves on the state’s Anaj Kharid portal with their bank account and crop details. After the purchase was made in the mandi or wholesale market, the details were verified by the inspectors, following which, money was directly transferred to the farmers’ bank account.

“There is no justification for not shifting to the DBT mode. Farmer unions have been demanding this for long in Punjab. When a seller sells to a buyer, the latter should be in charge of the money. No other party should be involved,” Sukhpal Singh said.

Unanswered questions

But several questions remnain. For one, the farmers are apprehensive about how the agents will react to the new arrangement. “In this direct transfer, a lot of distrust has creeped in,” Sukhvinder Singh from Shankarpur village in Patiala, told Down To Earth.

Narvinder Singh, a farmer from Gurdaspur, said he was happy with the direct cash transfer. He added the only worry was that his relationship with the aarthiyas had been affected. aarthiyas in Punjab constitute a huge chunk of the informal money lending system.

“We can depend on them whenever we need some money. But now, they won’t give loans to us,” he said.

The concerns are valid. The aarthiyas had gone on a strike against the decision to shift to the DBT mode at the start of the wheat procurement season.

Sarvesh Kumar, general manager, finance, Punjab Grains Procurement Corporation Ltd, said:

The shift to the DBT mode was a challenging task. We worked for 10-15 days straight to make this possible, to sort out the technical hiccups and allay farmers’ apprehensions. The major challenge was registering farmers and bringing aarthiyas on board.

The strike by the agents initially created hurdles in wheat purchase. But the strike was called off when they were assured by the state government of being paid their commission in advance.

Officials are also at pains to say that this is, in now way, the end of the aarthiyas.

“They register the farmers and certify them and their particulars. There are only around 3,000 government personnel in the mandis including inspectors. How can they manage lakhs of farmers? We need aarthiyas who are associated with various farmers,” Kumar said.

But experts said the government should instead focus on roping in farmer institutions like farmer producer organisations and agricultural cooperative societies in the mandi operations.

Besides, farmers have also reported systemic problems.

“I still have to get Rs 1.5 lakh more. The procurement happened a month ago but only Rs 2.3 lakh has come till now. The government says the amount will reach our bank accounts in 72 hours but I don’t know what’s wrong. I am hoping it will come soon,” Jasbir Singh said.

Kumar said there were initial delays but the process had been streamlined. Payments of all farmers registered with the portal will reach them, he said.

Many such registrations of farmers were done by the aarthiyas. Farmers are thus also apprehensive of some malpractices.

Sukhvinder Singh said: “There are cases where the aarthiyas has taken the payment money instead of farmers to clear his loans as he fears the farmer won’t pay him back the money under the new arrangement.”

All eyes are now on the upcoming Kharif season that could hold the answers to these questions. The department of food and civil supplies will also take up the task of updating the land records of farmers during that season. It was postponed this time around.

There are around 1.3 million wheat and paddy farmers in the government’s database. The government is hopeful that the payment will be smoother and fast-tracked from next season onwards.",0
798905,Double whammy for Bengal potato farmers: Costly seeds but low MSP,"A section of farmers said that an unknown disease has made potatoes unfit for consumption, adding to losses

Jayant Soren, 60, a potato cultivator in Hooghly district, said they have spent over Rs 30,000 per bigha on this year's production. Photo: Gurvinder Singh

Potato cultivators in West Bengal were afraid they will face severe losses as the price of good quality seeds have skyrocketed even as the minimum support price (MSP) fixed has remained relatively low.

“We will lose our homes if the selling price of potatoes is not increased,” said Jayanta Soren, a 60-year-old potato cultivator from Hooghly district, known for its potatoes. Soren has been growing potato for over two decades on his two bigha (0.26 hectares) land at Maliya village, around 40 kilometres from Kolkata, the state capital.

He claimed to have never been more financially strained than the current season: “The profits which we made last year is already gone,” he shared, adding that thousands of small and marginal potato farmers like him have been pushed to the verge of severe losses and heavy debts.

Minimum support

West Bengal is a major potato-growing states of India. The farmers in the state mainly grow Jyoti, Chandramukhi and hybrid varieties like Super S1, Super 6 and Pokhraj.

The retail price of potatoes in Kolkata was Rs 10 per kilogram (kg) for Jyoti, the most common variety grown and procured, and Rs 15-16 per kg for Chandramukhi.

In February this year, the state government fixed the MSP of potatoes (Jyoti variety) at Rs 300 for a bag (50 kg), which translated to Rs 6 per kg.

This was done to prevent the distress sale of produce like last year when initially farmers didn’t get a good price for the potatoes and then suddenly prices skyrocketed to Rs 1,400-1,500 per bag.

But potato cultivators are unsure how they are going to even cover the production cost at this selling price.

Seeds, logistics cut into profits

Cultivators in Bengal prefer seeds from Punjab because they are disease-free and offer better yield. The price of these seeds has increased to Rs 5,000-5,200 for each bag from Rs 3,000 last year, shared Manik Choudhary, 43, another farmer in Maliya village.

He explained the math:

“We need at least three bags of seeds for one bigha. This means, we will be spending Rs 15,000 on seeds alone. There are also other expenses like fertilisers, medicines, labour, rent for supplying water to the fields, and transportation expenses to warehouse.”

The yield is not more than 75-80 bags per bigha, shared Sk Ashraf Ali, another potato cultivator in the village.

For this yield, the farmers would get a maximum of Rs 24,000 (80x300) based on the MSP.

But the farmers have spent Rs 30,000-32,000 per bigha for growing potatos this year, said Soren. “It is clear there will be severe losses.”

Ali said they have requested the government to hike the MSP to ensure they are able to at least break even. “But nothing has been done yet.”

A section of the farmers also claimed that an unknown disease has attacked their produce and increased losses. “We are finding a disease in potatoes which is making them unfit for consumption. It destroyed half of my production,” rued Ajit Ruidas, 60, a cultivator from Baganbati village.

Farmers claimed that they were able to purchase the high-priced seeds with the massive profits made last year. “The price of potatoes had risen drastically last year which brought us good profits. The price of the seeds and fertilisers were also comparatively lower,” said Bishnu Das, 52, a potato farmer in neighbouring Baganbati village in Hooghly district.

Last year, the state produced 10 million tonnes of potatoes and the volume is expected to swell to 12 million tonnes in this year due to favourable climatic conditions, said agriculture experts.

Not keen to sell

Around 400,000 acres of land is under potato cultivation in Bengal and an estimated 10 lakh farmers are engaged in the farming from December to March.

All these cultivators have demanded that MSP be raised to at least Rs 700 per bag for them to recover costs and see profits.

“Apart from production, we also have to bear the cost of logistics. Labourers charge Rs 250 per day and 10 labourers have to be employed during sowing and harvesting. We are doing most of the work ourselves to minimise cost,” said Ali.

The warehouse operators, who charge a one-time fee of Rs 85 per bag, have observed that farmers are not very keen to sell produce because of low price. “They are waiting for the price to rise as it happened last year,” said Tapas Ghosh, staff at SN Cold Storage in Hooghly district.

He added:

“Moreover, the harvest is still ongoing in various other states. The demand for Bengal’s produce might swell if production is low in other states. Farmers would wait at least for a month before selling the produce.”

Government refutes claims

Agriculture experts working closely with the state government, however, dismissed claims of likely losses to be faced by the farmers.

“The MSP of Rs 6 per kg is a break-even price. But farmers are selling at Rs 9 per kg directly to buyers so there is no way that they can suffer losses,” Said Pradeep Mazumdar, agriculture advisor to the state government.

He added that the government has its ears to the ground and chief minister Mamata Banerjee set the MSP when the selling price fell to Rs 190-225 per bag. “It is the fourth time in the past 10 years that the government has fixed MSP of potatoes to prevent distress sales.”

The last time, MSP was set at Rs 250 per bag in 2019.

He, however, conceded that the rising cost of seeds has been a concern for farmers. He added:

“We have repeatedly asked them to get united against the escalating cost in order to put pressure on the Punjab seed traders. But most of them bypass and buy the seeds even at higher price.”

The government is developing indigenous seeds which would not only be priced less but would also be of higher quality, he shared. The move will help farmers reduce dependency on seed varieties from Punjab and enhance profits, the senior official said.",0
798914,"PM-KISAN: Agriculture ministry tells Parliament Rs 23,727 crore yet to be used","Rs 2,326.88 crore of Rs 139,370.15 crore was disbursed to those ineligible for the scheme; Rs 231.76 crore has been recovered

The Union government was yet to spend Rs 23,727 crore of the Rs 139,370.15 crore it has allocated for Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) since its inception in February 2019.

The amount is around 17 per cent of what was to be disbursed under the direct benefit transfer scheme for farmers that was announced in February 2019, during the presentation of Vote on Account for 2019-20.

For that year, Rs 20,000 crore was allocated, according to data submitted by the Centre's Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare in Parliament February 2, 2021. Of this, the Union government spent only Rs 6,050 crore,

The data was shared by the Union agriculture ministry in Parliament.

Similarly, in 2019-20, the allocated amount was Rs 54,370 crore; the amount spent was Rs 49,224 crore. In 2020-21, out of the allocated budget of Rs 65,000 crore, around Rs 5,000 crore still remained to be spent through March.

Allocation to the scheme in the Union Budget 2021-22 was the same as last year’s, at Rs 65,000 crore.

Rs 2,326.88 crore was disbursed to those ineligible for the scheme, of which Rs 231.76 crore was recovered, according to a written reply by Union Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar in the Lok Sabha.

PM-KISAN mandates a direct transfer of Rs 6,000 a year for eligible farmers, payable in three equal installments. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are among the states that disbursed the highest amount under the scheme.

“Key challenges like digitisation of tenure records, which is uneven, remain. The Union government is pursuing the issue with the states. The database on the total number of farmers is poor. On one hand, landless farmers are excluded from the scheme and on the other hand, the number of such families could be more than what the records for operational landholdings show,” said an official with the agriculture department.

A few states like West Bengal did not submit records, according to the data. The state has not disbursed any amount so far. While the central government has many a time slammed the Bengal government for not implementing the scheme, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee recently reportedly said her government submitted the details of 2.5 lakh farmers.

“Another issue, specifically in the north-eastern states, is that they have common property resources and the farm lands are owned by a community rather than one person. So, individual records are not maintained. Also, states have to take up the initiative of mobilising the farmers for registering with the scheme,” the official said.

He added that it would be taken up in the next meeting of Niti Ayog, which would be attended by all states.",0
798919,Agri share in GDP hit 20% after 17 years: Economic Survey,"Agriculture was the only sector to have clocked a positive growth at constant prices in 2020-21

The share of agriculture in gross domestic product (GDP) has reached almost 20 per cent for the first time in the last 17 years, making it the sole bright spot in GDP performance during 2020-21, according to the Economic Survey 2020-2021.

The resilience of the farming community in the face of adversities made agriculture the only sector to have clocked a positive growth of 3.4 per cent at constant prices in 2020-21, when other sectors slid.

The share of agriculture in GDP increased to 19.9 per cent in 2020-21 from 17.8 per cent in 2019-20. The last time the contribution of the agriculture sector in GDP was at 20 per cent was in 2003-04.

This was also the year when the sector clocked 9.5 per cent GDP growth, after the severe drought of 2002 when the growth rate was negative.

Following 2003-04, the share has remained between 17 and 19 per cent.

“The growth in GVA (gross value added) of agriculture and allied sectors has been fluctuating over time. However, during 2020-21, while the GVA for the entire economy contracted by 7.2 per cent, growth in GVA for agriculture maintained a positive growth of 3.4 per cent,” according to the survey.

The continuous supply of agricultural commodities, especially staples like rice, wheat, pulses and vegetables, also enabled food security.

In 2019-20 (according to fourth advance estimates), total food grain production (296.65 million tonnes) in the country was higher by 11.44 million tonnes than 2018-19.

It was also higher by 26.87 million tonnes than the previous five years’ (2014-15 to 2018-19) average production of 269.78 million tonnes.

The production also boosted allocation of food grains under the National Food Security Act (NFSA) that increased by 56 per cent in 2020-21, compared to 2019-20. The government allocated 943.53 lakh tonnes of food grains to states / Union territories till December 2020.

The survey also termed the new farm laws as a “remedy” and “not a malady” in a message to the farmer community opposing the laws.

“The three agricultural reform legislations are designed and intended primarily for the benefit of small and marginal farmers who constitute around 85 per cent of the total number of farmers and are the biggest sufferers of the regressive Agricultural Produce Market Committee regulated market regime. The newly introduced farm laws herald a new era of market freedom that can go a long way in the improvement of farmer welfare in India,” it said.

The survey gave a note of various consultations and reports on the need for agricultural reforms.

“The reforms in the agricultural sector were more overdue than even the labour reforms as the existing laws kept the Indian farmer enslaved to the local Mandi (wholesale market) and their rent-seeking intermediaries,” it said.

It called for a paradigm shift in how agriculture was viewed, “from a rural livelihood sector to a modern business enterprise”.",0
798955,Uttarakhand farmers fall back on traditional food processing methods to boost earnings,"Marketing of local varieties of food products can also increase farmers’ income

Entrepreneurs need two things to earn adequately from their produce: One, they need to know how the value of the product can be increased and two, find a market. In Uttarakhand, they are learning that using traditional knowledge can help them tap a niche market.

Communities traditionally used hydropower, for instance, to run gharats (water mills) to prepare flour. But with time, these gharats were abandoned to a large extent as streams dried and trained repairmen disappeared.

But flour prepared on these gharats is far better in quality, finer in texture, richer in flavour and more nutritious, as it is constantly cooled during the grinding process.

There is a renewed interest in reviving these mills. In Maldevta, Dehradun, Jai Singh has taken space from the irrigation department to instal a gharat. He sells wheat flour at Rs 35 per kilogram to tourists and local residents.

His flour has also found a market with Greenr Cafe in Gurugram, where it is used to prepare pizza bases and wraps. The flour reached the café via the startup, Valley Culture India. It was launched in 2019 by Shikha Prakash, an Ayurvedic physician and Robin Nagar, who spent decades in the aviation industry.

“We travel from village to village to identify products and find a market for them. We are trying to protect the traditional way of eating and farming in Uttarakhand,” said Prakash.

“Farmers have no logistical support,” said Nagar. These superfoods in the state do not reach markets a 100 kilometres away and even the all-weather roads are not helping these farmers, he shared. We are trying to help farmers decide what to grow and how to market, he adds.

To date, the company has created supply chains for around 20 products — spices, red rice, lentils, honey, ghee, nettle tea, chilli salt (chaat masala), among others.

The local honey is collected from bee farms in the forested Thano village. Collected from wild Himalayan flowers or litchi plantations, this honey retains pollen grains and remains nutritious and medicinal. The honey is processed simply by passing it through a single layer of muslin cloth.

Rajendra Singh Solanki, who runs a collective of bee farmers in Thano, said every farmer makes around Rs 250-300 / kg for raw honey, which is higher than what they earn by selling in bulk to big companies.

Last year, the companies paid around Rs 180 per kg but sometimes they go much lower to just around Rs 20-30 / kg, said Solanki.

Sometimes, the value addition process is simpler. In Uttarkashi, farmers used to earn around Rs 120-130 per kg from rajma (kidney beans) but now earn Rs 180-190 per kg after cleaning and grading the seeds. “Farmers have improved their earnings and are happy,” said Bhuvnesh Panwar, who has formed a group of some 3,000 small farmers in the area.

The state has many more products that can help farmers earn more if supply chains are established. These include tej patta (bay leaf), which is the first botanical plant from Uttarakhand to receive the Geographical Indications tag in 2016 but remains relatively unknown to the rest of the country, and the Himalayan timur which is similar to Schezwan pepper.

Our idea is that we create a gift hamper that people can take back home from Uttarakhand, said Prakash. “The products are selected so that people can use them as a better alternative to everyday food,” said Nagar.",0
798961,Home truth of Indian agriculture: Farm income declined in India in 7 years,"The average monthly income per farm household (considering only the paid out expenditure) is not the same as ‘net income / receipt earned by a farm household from crop cultivation’

In popular imagination, rise in food production is often confused with the income and prosperity of farmers.

The quarterly data on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Gross Value Added (GVA) is produced by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation or MoSPI).

It is related to the various sectors of the economy such as ‘agriculture, forestry & fishing’, ‘constructions’, ‘manufacturing’, etc. But even it does not shed much light on the incomes earned by the farmers or farming households.

The most reliable estimates on agricultural households’ income (and not the average income of a farmer in a particular time period) is produced by the National Statistical Office (under the MoSPI).

However, agricultural researchers, social scientists and economists had to wait for almost seven years this time to get the latest available data pertaining to the National Sample Survey (NSS) 77th Round.

The Situation Assessment Survey (SAS) of Agricultural Households and Land and Livestock Holdings of Households in Rural India (NSS 77th Round), was released recently.

It informs one about farm households’ income in the crop year 2018-19 and indebtedness in 2019 (as on the date of survey), among other things.

The data pertaining to the earlier SAS (under the NSS 70th Round), which was conducted in 2013, became available in 2014.

Change in nominal farm incomes

Let us try to understand the changes that happened to the incomes of farm households between crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19.

It needs to be mentioned at the outset that in the 77th Round of NSS, a farm household was defined as a household receiving value of produce more than Rs 4,000 from agricultural activities.

These activities included cultivation of field crops, horticultural crops, fodder crops, plantation, animal husbandry, poultry, fishery, piggery, bee-keeping, vermiculture, sericulture, etc.

The other criterion was that such a household must have at least one member self-employed in agriculture, either in the principal status or in subsidiary status during the last 365 days.

Households which were entirely agricultural labour households and households receiving income entirely from coastal fishing, activity of rural artisans and agricultural services were not considered as farm households.

They were kept outside the scope of the survey. The income cut-off used in the NSS 77th Round for identifying the agricultural households has been updated by adjusting for inflation.

However, in the 70th Round of NSS, a farm household was defined as a household receiving value of produce more than Rs 3,000 from agricultural activities.

Such a household also had at least one member self-employed in agriculture either in the principal status or in subsidiary status during the last 365 days.

Readers should note here that in the NABARD All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey 2016-17 (ie NAFIS 2016-17), the threshold level of annual agricultural income was Rs 5,000, which has not been discussed in this piece.

Average monthly income (in Rs) per agricultural household (considering only the paid out expenditure) in crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19

Note: Rate of inflation calculated by the author

Source: SAS 2019 NSS 77th Round; SAS 2013 NSS 70th Round; Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy 2020-21, RBI; Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy 2015-16, RBI

The above graphic shows that the average monthly income of a farm household (when only the paid out expenditure is considered) was Rs 10,218 during crop year 2018-19.

It was arrived at by adding together various constituents ie ‘income from wages’ (Rs 4,063), ‘income from leasing out of land’ (Rs 134), ‘net receipt from crop production’ (Rs 3,798), ‘net receipt from animal farming’ (Rs 1,582) and ‘net receipt from non-farm business’ (Rs 641).

The average farm income (ie Rs 6,427) of an agricultural household (when only the paid out expenditure is considered) during crop year 2012-13 was computed by totalling various components.

These included ‘income from wages’ (Rs 2,071), ‘net receipt from cultivation / crop production when only the paid out expenditure is considered’ (Rs 3,081), ‘net receipt from farming of animals’ (Rs 763) and ‘net receipt from non-farm business’ (Rs 512).

The newly released report (NSS 77th Round) clearly mentions that the ‘income of agricultural households from leasing out of land’ was not collected in the previous rounds of the SAS.

However, in most media reports, this fact was ignored. They compared the average farm incomes of an agricultural household between crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19.

They subsequently concluded that the average monthly farm incomes grew by almost 59.0 per cent between those two crop years. However, this kind of comparison is methodologically incorrect as it compares apples against oranges.

In order to compare apples against apples, the ‘income from leasing out of land’ ought to be deducted from the average monthly income of an agricultural household in crop year 2018-19.

Once done, the modified average monthly farm income turns out to be Rs 10,084 in crop year 2018-19.

It would be now methodologically correct to state that the average monthly income (in nominal terms) of a farm household increased from Rs 6,427 to Rs 10,084 between the crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19 ie by around 56.9 per cent.

Change in real farm incomes

It is found after computing that the average ‘Consumer Price Index - Combined’ grew by almost 34.0 per cent between crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19.

If we take that into account, then the growth in the average monthly income per farm household (considering only the paid out expenditure) in real terms during this time period was 22.9 per cent in India.

The average ‘CPI - Rural’ increased by around 35.3 per cent between the crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19.

If we take that into consideration, then the growth in the average monthly income per agricultural household (considering only the paid out expenditure) in real terms during this time period was 21.6 per cent at the national level.

Put differently, in real terms, the average monthly income of a farm household (considering only the paid out expenditure) increased between the crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19. Seeing this, many would conclude that everything is well and fine with the farming community.

It should be kept in mind that the average monthly income per farm household (considering only the paid out expenditure) is not the same as ‘net income / receipt earned by a farm household from crop cultivation’.

As explained above, the latter is just one of the components of the former.

If the rate of inflation of 34.0 per cent between the crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19 (in average ‘Consumer Price Index - Combined’) is taken into account, then the growth in the average monthly ‘net receipt from crop production or cultivation’ per farm household (considering only the paid out expenditure) in real terms during this time period was -10.7 per cent in India.

If the rate of inflation of 35.3 per cent between the crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19 (in average ‘CPI - Rural’) is taken into consideration, then the growth in the average monthly ‘net receipt from crop production or cultivation’ per farm household (considering only the paid out expenditure) in real terms during this time period was -12.0 per cent in India.

Therefore, it can be said that in real terms, the average monthly ‘net receipt earned by a farm household from crop cultivation’ (considering only the paid out expenditure) fell between the crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19.

Between crop years 2012-13 and 2018-19, the highest increase (in per cent) in real terms was noticed for the average monthly ‘income from animal farming’, followed by the average monthly ‘income from wages’.

Reference period

For the NSS 77th Round, information was collected primarily for the agricultural year 2018-19 in two visits, namely visit-1 and visit-2.

For crops, information on expenses and receipts from cultivation were collected for the period July to December 2018 in visit-1 and for January to June 2019 in visit-2.

However, it was ensured that all the crops, whether principal or not, harvested during agricultural year 2018-19 were duly considered in either visit-1 or visit-2.

The same reference period was used for collecting information on productive assets. For other items of information, different reference periods were used, such as, ‘as on the date of survey’ for indebtedness, ‘last 30 days’ for farming of animals and non-farm business.

For information on land possession, productive assets and expenses and receipts from cultivation, earnings from wages / salaried employment, earnings from pensionm / remittances the reference period was July to December 2018 in visit-1 and January to June 2019 in visit-2.

The NSS 70th Round survey was conducted during the calendar year 2013 (January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2013). The same household was visited twice during the survey period.

The period of first visit (visit-1) was January to July 2013 and that of second visit (visit-2) was August to December, 2013. For crops, information on expenses and receipts from cultivation were collected for the period July to December, 2012 in visit-1 and for January to June, 2013 in visit-2.

However, it was ensured that all the crops, whether principal or not, harvested during agricultural year 2012-13 were duly considered in either visit-1 or visit-2. The same reference period was used for collecting information on productive assets.

For other items of information, different reference periods were used, viz., ‘as on the date of survey’ for land possession and indebtedness, ‘last 30 days’ for farming of animals, non-farm business and consumer expenditure and ‘last 365 days’ for principal source of income.

For information on productive assets and expenses and receipts from cultivation, the reference period was July to December 2012 in visit-1 and January to June 2013 in visit-2.

798963,Coffee bean prices have doubled in the past year and may double again – what’s going on?,"The principal reason for surging prices is a series of environmental events in Brazil

International Coffee Day feels very different this year. Introduced by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on October 1, 2015 to raise awareness of the product and the challenges faced by producers, the day has usually focused on how low prices paid for unroasted beans barely cover farmers’ costs — let alone support their families.

Not this year, though. In the past 12 months, the C price — the benchmark price for commodity-grade Arabica coffee on the New York International Commodity Exchange — has risen from US$1.07 (£0.80) per pound (454g) to around US$1.95. Back in July, it touched US$2.08.

Arabica bean prices (US$/lb)

Nearly all contracts for coffee delivery are benchmarked against the C price, with the result that prices for green Arabica (unroasted beans) have risen by over 80 per cent during the past year.

Those for Robusta coffee — a cheaper, less palatable alternative — have risen over 30 per cent. And there is every chance that these prices will rise higher in the coming months. We may be on the verge of a major price correction that shifts the market upwards for years to come.

Why coffee got expensive

The principal reason for surging prices is a series of environmental events in Brazil. By far the world’s leading coffee producer, Brazil accounts for around 35 per cent of global harvest.

The volume of production regularly fluctuates between “on” and “off” years, and usually this is not sufficient to greatly affect prices because producers mitigate their risks through stock management and hedging prices using the coffee futures market.

However, yields in 2021 are likely to be dramatically lower. This is due to a combination of a severe drought earlier in the season, which reduced the numbers of coffee cherries and recent intense frosts that might further damage the fruit and even the trees. The Brazilian authorities are projecting the lowest Arabica harvest for 12 years.

The big question is how this affects future production. Coffee trees can take up to five years to mature, so it will take a few seasons before the scale of the damage is clear.

If, as some respected reporters are suggesting, the frost causes maximum damage — potentially hitting two-thirds of trees — there may be a long-lasting drop in world supplies. This could see prices breaking through the US$3.00 and even US$4.00 barrier.

The long coffee cycle

The history of coffee has been characterised by extreme price volatility. Periods of excessive supplies have progressively driven down prices until a catastrophic event — either environmental or political — results in a correction.

During the 1930s, a combination of bumper harvests and weak consumer demand in the depression era led to a massive supply glut. To reduce excess stock, Brazil resorted to dumping coffee at sea and also converting it into locomotive fuel.

At the other extreme, many coffee trees were killed in 1975 when Brazil was struck by a series of “black” frosts. This led to a 60 per cent fall in output in the following harvest, and prices trebling between 1975 and 1977.

In 1962, the ICO introduced producer quotas to try and keep prices buoyant in the face of such highs and lows. This was supported by the United States to avoid communism spreading from Cuba to mainland Latin America, but it was abandoned on American insistence after 1989.

This led to an over-supply and ultimately a coffee crisis at the end of the century in which the C price remained under US$1.00 for four straight years. It had tended to trade between about US$1.00 and US$2.00 per pound and the price crash saw many producers going hungry.

The price only recovered when a coffee leaf rust infected a significant portion of Central American and Colombian production. The bitter irony of the coffee market is that prices for producers only improve when many of them suffer unsustainable losses.

The Robusta problem

Coffee prices fell in the latter part of the 2010s primarily as a result of the expansion of global production. Most notable was Vietnam, which is now the world’s second largest coffee producer and accounts for around 18 per cent of total global production. As much as 95 per cent of Vietnamese output is Robusta.

Robusta was actually first used for coffee cultivation because of an environmental catastrophe, when east Asia’s coffee production was virtually wiped out by coffee leaf rust during the late 19th century.

In more recent times, procedures for “cleaning” Robusta to reduce off-flavours have improved to the point that roasters increasingly resort to raising its proportion within a blend. This is particularly done when targeting markets which are primarily driven by price, such as instant coffee.

If prices keep spiking now, using more Robusta in blends could prevent coffee from becoming too expensive for consumers. But this will be difficult to do, at least short-term, because of severe COVID-19 restrictions in Vietnam.

This has caused considerable disruptions both to transporting coffee from the central highlands to the export hub of Ho Chi Minh city and then managing the onward shipping logistics. The same issues have arisen in many coffee-producing nations.

Consequently we have brokers battling to secure sufficient stocks, roasters contemplating how to pass on price rises to their business customers and consumers facing the prospect of paying higher prices for household coffee products.

But will producers be the winners in this latest price surge? Those Brazilian agribusinesses that survive the immediate impact of the frosts surely will, as too the well-capitalised, medium-sized farms of Latin America.

What, though, of the smallholders and subsistence farmers who make up 95 per cent of coffee farmers? For years, the ICO and its member states have presented these farmers as the victims of global market forces; now we will find out if these players are capable of delivering back to farmers the increased value their coffee is generating. If so, then International Coffee Day will indeed be something to celebrate.

799048,Pesticide Management Bill 2020: What could have made it better,"The bill was introduced after much delay

The Pesticide Management Bill, 2020 was introduced in the Rajya Sabha by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on March 23 and will be discussed when the upper house of Parliament reconvenes.

The bill will repeal the Insecticide Act, 1968 that currently regulates pesticide use in the country. It was approved by the Union cabinet in February 2020.

A draft Pesticide Management Bill, 2017 was earlier released for comments in February 2018.

A similar bill was in discussion in 2008, without any break-through.

The reason cited by the government for introducing this new bill was the inadequacy of the 50-year-old insecticide law to meet the needs of multi-dimensional management and administration of pesticides.

This included a lack of sufficient deterrence against violation, no stricter penalty to safeguard farmer interests and no mechanism to regulate pricing and disposal in an environmentally sound manner.

Mechanisms to regulate pesticides were, however, mentioned in the bill.

These included manufacture, import, packaging, labelling, pricing, storage, advertisement, sale, transport, distribution, use and disposal in order to ensure availability of safe and effective pesticides.

The purpose of the bill is to minimise risk to human beings, animals, living organisms other than pests and the environment, with an endeavour to promote pesticides that are biological and based on traditional knowledge.

A look at the specifics mentioned, however, suggest otherwise.

First, it conveniently ignores critical areas that, if not factored-in, will make the bill a weak and inadequate law to manage pesticides — hazardous chemicals linked to poor health and death for many decades.

Second, some aspects mentioned in the bill need to be strengthened before it becomes a law.

Regulation of advertisement and promotion

Pesticides continue to be advertised and promoted like consumer products, despite being deadly chemicals. They are advertised through multiple media and targeted at farmers who are often unaware of marketing tactics.

The bill does not mention this. Another strategy pesticide companies use is to aggressively promote their products through representatives or dealers.

They are often the last point of contact with farmers and are known to heavily influence pesticide use. The bill is surprisingly silent on this too.

It briefly mentions these two related issues at the beginning, whereas this important aspect deserves a separate chapter, just like it is being done for the registration of pesticides.

Advertisement and promotion, if well-regulated, can limit pesticide misuse. Pesticides should not be allowed to be sold or promoted directly to the consumer since they are deadly chemicals and not consumer products.

This is more because of the fact that the agriculture extension machinery — an important stakeholder group with supposedly no conflict of interest — is either missing or failing to perform its role effectively.

Pesticides should therefore be regulated more like drugs, which are not advertised and cannot be promoted directly to the consumer.

This also means that the bill should have provisions to ensure that the last point of contact to farmers can never be a company representative.

The income of a pesticide company representative should be delinked from its sale. Companies should be told to follow a code of conduct, a report of which should be considered to be available for audit.

Agriculture extension system

There is huge gap in the dissemination of correct information to the farmer and there is no reliable stakeholder at the local level to guide farmers about the use of pesticides.

This gap is often exploited by pesticide companies through the extensive presence of a sales force and dealers at a local level.

This leads to excessive and unwanted use of pesticides and irreversible harm to the ecosystem, natural resources, biodiversity, human health and animal health.

This is not sustainable and therefore unacceptable. The agriculture extension system is a key stakeholder in limiting pesticide misuse, but the bill does not give due attention to this system.

If the bill is about managing pesticides, this aspect deserves a separate section in the bill.

Necessary provisions should be mentioned to ensure the agriculture extension system plays a very active role in prescribing, advising and creating awareness about pesticide use.

Enabling provisions should be introduced to help revive the extension system, if required.

The provisions should also direct how the extension system should be strengthened with support from multiple modalities, including the Krishi Vigyan Kendra, agricultural universities, Indian Council of Agricultural Research institutions, and toll-free helpline systems.

Labelling and packaging

Labelling and packaging of pesticides is important to guide the end user — usually a farmer in this case — about what lies in the package and instructions on how to use, handle and safely dispose the contents and the package.

This is a critical aspect that the bill has failed to give necessary attention to.

The bill should include provisions that provide necessary directions to ensure labelling and packaging is well regulated through the bill in line with the best global practices.

Personal protective equipment (PPE)

Deaths from application of pesticides is a known issue in India.

One solution is to ensure farmers wear PPE while spraying.

This is an important aspect to limit deaths and severe illness from acute toxicity. The bill should, therefore, have necessary provisions in it.

It should aim to ensure that companies selling pesticides provide safety gear of appropriate quality along with pesticides.

The agriculture extension machinery should be accountable for creating awareness and overseeing the proper usage of PPEs by farmers while applying pesticides, particularly those that are hazardous because of acute toxicity in them.

Pesticides whose application warrants the use of uncomfortable, expensive or not readily available PPEs, should be avoided, according to the international code of conduct on pesticide management, released by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization.

This holds true especially in the case of small-scale users and farm workers in hot climates.

Governance mechanism

The governance mechanisms proposed to execute the provisions of the bill must be more inclusive and the relationships among them must be clearly defined.

First, there needs to be adequate representation of stakeholders and experts from agro-ecology, environment, farmers, civil society, health and consumers in the Central Pesticide Board as well the registration committee.

This is not the case in the proposed bill. Alternatively, there should be an introduction of an independent oversight committee to review the decisions of the registration committee.

Second, how the board and committee are linked and would work together must be defined clearly in the bill.

Third, a better balance in the role and powers of states and the Union government needs to be attained.

States are proposed to have powers to ban a pesticide for up to a year. A separate provision, however, mentions the union government would manage the pesticide industry, taking away these powers from the states.

Class I pesticides

The bill includes an important aspect stating that extremely and highly hazardous pesticides — considered Class I pesticides by the WHO due to acute toxicity — are to be used only after prescription.

It is, however, important that accountability and conditions with respect to such prescriptions be described in the bill.

For example, who should be the prescriber and what should be the guiding conditions to allow the use of such pesticides.

Further, the bill should create provisions to enable phase out of class I pesticides by re-evaluating already registered pesticides and developing a phase-out plan.

The bill should also include this in the criteria to register any new pesticide, wherein no such pesticide is registered as long as a safer alternative exists.

‘Precautionary principle’ and ‘Polluter Pays’ principles missing

The precautionary principle should be included in any bill that deals with hazardous chemicals, especially if such chemicals are to be applied on food and feed crops.

The bill, however, does not mention this. The provisions related to registration in the bill must include it, thereby ensuring that a pesticide with riskier, unsafe profile, despite having limited evidence, should not be registered.

Any pesticide banned in other countries due to acute or chronic toxicity should also not be allowed in India.

Pesticides with no assessment of long-term safety and environmental impact should not be preferred for registration.

The ‘polluter Pays’ principle is also critical. India has seen cases where pesticide manufacturing plants have severely damaged the health of the people and environment.

For example, Union Carbide India Ltd before and after the Bhopal gas tragedy was responsible for long-term toxicity in soil, ground water and health in the nearby region.

It is critical that the bill includes the manufacturing aspects of managing pesticides.

The act should provide provisions for a robust grievance redressal system and compensation, in addition to the above-mentioned points.

Penalties should also be in proportion to the sales of pesticides, since a penalty of a few lakh rupees may not be a big enough deterrent for big companies.

A database of pesticides should also be created at the tehsil level.

799053,Pesticide Management Bill 2020 must address important concerns,"This is because agriculture in India is largely dependent on chemicals including pesticides and their usage has a huge impact on the health of humans, animals, bio-diversity and the environment

Pesticides are regulated in India through the Insecticides Act, 1968 and Insecticides Rules, 1971. The experience in administering this Act over the last five decades has exposed certain gaps which spurred the need to propose a new law.

The Pesticide Management Bill (PMB) has been in discussion since 2008. The Draft Pesticide Management Bill 2017 was released by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare (MoFAW) for stakeholder comments on February 19, 2018.

Subsequently, a new Pesticide Management Bill was created and same has now been approved by the Union Cabinet on February 12, 2020. This new bill will be tabled in Parliament in this session and the earlier version will be withdrawn by the government.

Insecticides, fungicides and herbicides are used in India, with insecticides forming the highest share. India is among the largest producers of pesticides in the world. According to a report by database Research and Markets, the Indian pesticides market was worth Rs 197 billion in 2018.

The market is further projected to reach a value of Rs 316 billion by 2024, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 8.1 per cent during 2019-2024. As on October, 2019, a total of 292 pesticides were registered in India.

The total as well as per hectare consumption of pesticides in India shows a significant increase after 2009-10. The recent increase in pesticide use is said to be because of higher use of herbicides as cost of manual weed control has risen due to increase in agricultural wages.

Total pesticide consumption is the highest in Maharashtra, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana. On the other hand, per hectare consumption of pesticides was the highest in Punjab (0.74 kg), followed by Haryana (0.62 kg) and Maharashtra (0.57 kg) during 2016-17.

The upcoming Pesticide Management Bill is of critical importance, as agriculture in India is largely dependent on chemicals, including pesticides and their overuse and misuse has a huge impact on the health of humans, animals, bio-diversity and the environment.

Instances of acute toxicity of farmers due to pesticides are common and chronic toxicity of pesticides is a big health threat for consumers. The Draft Pesticide Management Bill 2017 had various issues and concerns. Hopefully, these concerns would have been addressed in the upcoming bill.

Focus on minimal use of pesticides

The bill must consider minimising the use of pesticides, recognising the fact that pesticide use is not sustainable. It is a temporary stop-gap arrangement wherein the aim should be to use it as a last-resort.

Not recognizing this would be a critical failure as using pesticides for decades has contributed significantly to the current ecological, economical and existential crisis of the Indian agriculture sector. Promoting pesticides will take India away from sustainable agriculture practices and agro-ecology.

Greater say to state governments

Inadequate representation and powers to the state governments is a serious concern, raised by various state governments as well. There have been several instances, where states (like Punjab, Kerala etc) wanted to ban a particular herbicide like glyphosate in their respective states but were not allowed to do so for a long time.

State governments should have the power to regulate pesticides as they have a better idea about the agro-ecological aspects in their state. However, states need not be given the power to allow a pesticide, which is otherwise not approved by the Registration Committee.

Penalties in proportion to sales needed

Small financial penalty would not be enough deterrence for a big company selling pesticides worth crores of rupees. For instance, a fine of Rs 100,000 to 500,000 for selling misbranded pesticides will not deter an industry giant in the business of manufacturing pesticides.

Even a penalty of Rs 10-50 lakh proposed for certain cases may not be deterrent enough. Financial penalties should be proportional to the value of total sales of the concerned pesticide in India. It should not be based only on annual turnover because the damage may not be limited to one year.

Pesticide promotion must not be allowed

Just like pharmaceutical drugs, pesticides due to their hazardous nature, must not be allowed to be promoted. All kinds of advertisements of pesticides must be banned in India.

Advertisements are by design suited to the commercial interest of the advertiser and aimed at influencing the buying behavior of farmers, who are often uneducated and unaware of the marketing tactics.

Interaction of pesticide company / dealer representatives with farmers must not be allowed and considered illegal. Delink income of company / dealer representatives from sales of pesticides. A ‘code of conduct’ must be developed and followed by the pesticide companies.

Class I pesticides should be banned

Based on acute toxicity, the World Health Organization classifies certain pesticides as extremely hazardous (Class Ia) and highly hazardous (Class Ib). Necessary provisions should be made in the bill to ban sale and use of Class I pesticides.

Prior to August 2018, around 18 Class I pesticides were allowed in India; few of them were used heavily and accounted for about 30 per cent of the total pesticides used in India. These have also been banned for use in several countries.

In August, 2018, the MoAFW banned 18 pesticides, three years after the recommendations of the Anupam Varma Committee. But, it left out two heavily-used Class I pesticides: Monocrotophos and Carbofuran.

Deaths related to pesticide poisoning in India are common. In 2014, the National Crimes Records Bureau recorded 7,365 cases of poisoning due to accidental intake of insecticides / pesticides, out of which 5,915 died. In 2015, 7,060 deaths were reported out of 7,672 cases.

Farmers must be made aware of judicious usage

Pesticides are hazardous chemicals with multiple, severe and even fatal, acute as well as chronic toxic effects. They must be sold and used cautiously under supervision like drugs.

Like drugs, target, dosing, mode of application and unbiased advice for the usage of pesticide is critical. Over the counter availability and dealer influence have caused severe overuses and misuses. Therefore, proper provision should be made to increase the knowledge of farmers by competent unbiased people.

No pesticides without personal protective equipments, provision for acute emergencies and polluter pays principle

The bill must incorporate a provision which makes it illegal to sell a pesticide by a pesticide company without personal protective equipments or safety gear. Provision of systems and standard operating procedures for acute medical emergencies should also be made.

The Polluter Pays’ principle should be the basis for fixing liability and compensation from the company. Any pesticide registration must follow transparent assessment procedure.

Further, legislative powers to regulate pesticides should be transferred to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare from the MoAFW, to address the health-related concerns without any conflict of interest.

Phase out chemical pesticides as soon as possible by providing available alternatives

Today, there are enough well-proven, successful alternative agro-ecological methods of pest management without using any chemical pesticide in India and globally. Such methods must be mainstreamed and promoted among farmers.

Lessons learnt from successful farming community initiatives like Keet Sakshatra Pathshala, Jind, Haryana and Non Pesticide Management Programme implemented by Andhra Pradesh and other successful alternative approaches should be identified and mainstreamed. Further, research and innovations must be made to phase out the usage of chemical pesticides completely as soon as possible.",0
799096,Is doubling India’s farmers’ income doable?,"Science, technology and new knowledge can play crucial roles in supporting livelihoods for the vulnerable. Identifying right kind of tech support is crucial, especially in agriculture

Forty years since India gained independence, what has really changed for the farmers of today? During this crucial post-independence period, agriculture contributed 45 per cent of the country’s GDP, employing the majority of Indian workers. After an impressive increase in agricultural production in the first two Five Year Plans, a period of stagnancy set in from the 1960s, preceding the “Green Revolution”.

As the economy opened up post liberalisation (1991), globalisation promoted other sectors into generating more employment and economic growth. But, despite the reduction to 18 per cent in agriculture’s contribution to the GDP, agriculture and allied activities still employ the vast majority of the population.

India’s agrarian sector has undergone various reforms: increase productivity to meet the demands of a rising population, make farming inclusive, reform land tenures, ensure more benefits to farmers, end exploitation, encourage better water management practices and so on.The National Commission for Farmers, established in 2004 made comprehensive recommendations covering land reforms, soil testing, augmenting water availability, agriculture productivity, credit and insurance, food security and farmers competitiveness.

But through all these broad sectoral strategies and policy initiatives, we need to ask, have farmers actually substantially increased their incomes? The answer to this is no. The now constituted Doubling Farmers’ Income (DFI) Committee wants to do more. It places farmers’ income at the core of India’s mandate. So what will it really take to double farmers’ incomes in the country?

Science, technology and new knowledge can play crucial roles in supporting livelihoods for the vulnerable. Identifying the right kind of tech support is crucial to development progress, even more so in the context of agriculture. Augmenting water availability and efficiency, agriculture productivity, risk mitigation strategies and innovations on new models may be the ways to step up progress further.

Meanwhile an emboldened risk is making farmer livelihoods more precarious. Climate has always played havoc with the lives of farmers, and it has increasingly become more unpredictable. The country faces increasingly extreme weather conditions such as severe droughts and floods. This is hampering farmers’ production capacity, and impacting their livelihoods. Can science and innovation help here too? All while increasing farmers’ incomes?

A vivid example of technology disrupting and improving old methods is found in the crop insurance sector. To ensure they can endure extreme weather events, hundreds of Indian farmers have been provided insurance services through an index-based flood insurance (IBFI) system initiated by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), through WLE andCCAFS research programmes. This tool combines satellite images with hydrological modelling to predetermine flood thresholds, which has led to quicker compensation payouts to farmers in times of crop failure. This is especially helpful to low-income, flood-prone communities in the struggle against climate impacts.

This innovation was built on data generated from satellites, which mapped out vulnerable states within the country—places most likely to be impacted by floods or droughts. In making information available to farmers at the right time they can plan better cropping cycles and prepare for too much or too little water, or even to plan for other income sources during risky periods. At the same time, this data is also used by the insurance companies to plan crop insurance packages for farmers, making payouts faster and fairer.

In 2018, IWMI and partners rolled out the two-year IBFI pilot in six villages in Muzaffarpur district, Bihar covering 408 farms. Of those, 170 farmers faced climate shocks and received payouts up to Rs 20,000 per hectare of insured paddy crop. IBFI is set to roll out more widelyacross India, as it is seen as a protection against weather crises pushing farmers back into a poverty trap.

Another promising tech fix has been solar powered irrigation. Many see it as a panacea to India’s water access and availability problems, offering farmers cheaper, more accessible technology that cuts carbon emissions. Solar powered pumps are now deployed to bring groundwater to millions of farmer fields. And to ensure farmers don’t deplete groundwater resources through over-pumping, the IWMI-Tata Programme supports farmer cooperatives, allowing users to pool their surplus solar-generated electricity and sell it back to the grid. So what was once just an irrigation solution has become a way to harvest the sun as a ‘cash crop,’ giving communities another source of income, and generating clean power.

These cases provide classic examples of how science, innovation and technology can help support farmers to secure and grow income levels, while helping them navigate worsening climate-related risks. Of course, the right investments in technology only work when paired with infrastructure development, enabling policies, and the best protections for communities and the environment. But if India can come together on these key challenges, knowledge and tech have a chance to lead India to the future.

It’s time to double down on smart technology, so we can finally double the incomes of farmers—and be doubly ready for climate challenges.",0
799370,How will the drought in India affect food prices worldwide?,"Cristina Coslet is Country Monitor, Far East Asia at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations

Drought in India triggered uncertainties in food grain market in 2008-09. How will the 2015-16 water crisis in the country affect the market worldwide?

Reduced 2015 monsoon rains and low irrigation water availabilities in India have negatively affected the main 2015 and 2016 winter (rabi) crop seasons. However, although reduced production of major food cereals such as rice and wheat is forecast, a significant impact on the world market is not implicit. The Government of India still holds sizeable stocks of food grains, which although lower than recent years’ average, would be sufficient to cover the needs of an expanded Public Distribution System. Coupled with generally stable local quotations, especially in the case of rice, the comfortable level of Government reserves render restrictions on exports, such as the ones put in place in 2008,unlikely.

Top three rice exporters of the world—India, Thailand and Vietnam have been hit by drought. How will this affect global availability of rice and its prices?

Although Viet Nam is also expected to harvest a smaller crop, production shortfalls have been most pronounced in India and Thailand. The two countries are in fact expected to be largely responsible for a 4.1 million tonnes reduction in world rice output in 2015-16 to 490.3 million tonnes.

Generally, supply shortfalls in the major rice exporting countries would tend to be supportive of international prices. This would be especially so in a seasonally tight period such as the one we are in. However, one must bear in mind that the production falls in the major rice exporting countries, while tightening supplies for export, have been accompanied by a simultaneous reduction in world import demand.

For instance, in Asia, important buyers such as Bangladesh, the Philippines and Indonesia have been largely absent from the market in recent months. In Africa, depreciating local currencies have also significantly constrained countries’ ability to purchase dollar-denominated supplies from the international market. This reduction in import demand has in fact contributed to keep international rice prices at comparatively subdued levels to date.

Although falling, rice reserves also remain plentiful in both India and Thailand. For instance, the Government of Thailand presently holds an estimated 11.4 million tonnes of rice on reserve. This volume exceeds the normal quantity of exports by the country and would be sufficient to cover 25 per cent of projected global trade in rice in 2016. Because of their sheer size and the cost of maintaining them, Thai authorities have indeed announced plans to accelerate the lease of supplies from state reserves in the coming months. In sum, whether or not international rice prices will respond to the weather-induced production shortfalls in the major exporting countries will heavily depend on import decisions, their timing, currency factors and policies concerning the release of Government stocks.

(Inputs from Concepción Calpe and Shirley Mustafa)

Some areas in India are undergoing severe water crisis for the second consecutive year, how will this affect agriculture, which is largely rainwater-fed?

Reduced water levels in major reservoirs, following weak monsoon precipitation, coupled with unseasonably high temperatures and below-average rains between October 2015 and February 2016, associated with the El Niño event, negatively affected on the mainly irrigated 2016 wheat crop and 2015 secondary season rice. As to the 2016 mainly rain-fed main season crops, including rice, maize, sorghum and millet, planting operations are not set to start before the end of May. Therefore, the performance of the monsoon rains, which normally start in early June, will prove critical in determining this season’s success. In this connection, a likelihood of normal to above-normal monsoon rains in 2016, as forecast by the India Meteorological Department, is encouraging, since more conducive weather could permit fields that were left idle last year because of scarce precipitation to return to cultivation, while also boosting yields.",0
799449,October-April sugar output up 14% at 342.37 lt,"Share this

06 May 2022, New Delhi: Sugar mills across the country have produced 342.37 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar between October 1, 2021, and April 30, 2022. This is about 42 lt or 14 per cent higher than 300.29 lt produced during the same period last season (October 2020-September 2021).

The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) has estimated that during the current season, the industry should be able to export over 90 lt of sugar.

In a statement, ISMA said compared with 106 sugar mills that were crushing sugarcane in April 2021, about 217 crushed the cane in April this year. In Maharashtra, sugar production till April 30, 2022, was 132.06 lt against 105.63 lt produced a year ago, almost 26.4 lt higher than last year.

In the current sugar season, 76 mills have closed their crushing operations in the State and 123 are still operating compared with the 23 mills that operated last year during the year-ago period.

“The mills are currently facing the problem in harvesting and transportation of harvestable cane still available in the State. Accordingly, the State government has announced assistance to enable mills to continue crushing till cane lasts,” ISMA stated in a press release.

Uttar Pradesh sugar mills have produced 98.98 lt of sugar as of April 30, 2022 — which is 6.64 lt lower than the output of 105.62 lt achieved by them last year on the corresponding date. Of the 120 mills operated this year, 78 have ended their crushing and 42 mills continue to operate against 45 mills that were operating on April 30, 2021.

Of the 72 mills operating in Karnataka, 70 have already closed their crushing operations for the main season, while two are in operation. The State has produced 59.02 lt of sugar. However, a few closed mills might operate in the special season commencing June-July. During the corresponding period last year, all the 66 sugar mills had closed their operations and produced 42.48 lt of sugar.

Higher estimation

As per reports from sugar mills and estimations made by ISMA, sugar sales by the end of March 2022 have been estimated at 136.14 lt (129.48 lt). Further, the domestic sugar sales quota released by the government up to May is also higher by 6.5 lt. ISMA expects domestic consumption in the current season to be at 272 lt (265.5 lt). As per reports from the trade, around 82-83 lt of sugar have been contracted for exports so far. Of this, nearly 68 -70 lt are estimated to have been physically exported till April-end compared with 43.19 lt a year ago.

Ethanol production

On the ethanol front, against the total LOI quantity of 425.17 crore litres, 410.32 crore litres have been contracted for and 168.66 crore litres of ethanol have been supplied as on April 24. Of the total supply so far, about 149.16 crore litres i.e., over 88 per cent have been supplied by the sugar industry. The country, on an average, has achieved a blending percentage of 9.82 per cent on the corresponding date, ISMA said.",1
799475,FAO Food Price Index rises further in September,"Share this

08 October 2021, Rome: World food commodity prices rose in September, led by tightening supply conditions and robust demand for staples such as wheat and palm oil, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reported today.

The FAO Food Price Index averaged 130.0 points in September, up 1.2 percent from August and 32.8 percent higher than in September 2020. The index tracks monthly changes in the international prices of commonly-traded food commodities.

The FAO Cereal Price Index in September increased by 2.0 percent from the previous month, with world wheat prices up almost 4 percent – and as much as 41 percent higher than a year earlier – due to tightening export availabilities amid strong demand. World rice prices also rose in September, while those of maize increased by a moderate 0.3 percent – averaging 38 percent higher year-on-year – as improved global crop prospects and the start of harvests in the United States of America and Ukraine largely countered the impact of hurricane-related port disruptions in the U.S.

“Among major cereals, wheat will be the focus in the coming weeks as demand need to be tested against fast rising prices,” says FAO Senior Economist Abdolreza Abbassian.

The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index was up 1.7 percent on the month – and about 60 percent from September 2020 – as international palm oil prices reached 10-year highs due to robust global import demand and concerns over migrant labour shortages impacting production in Malaysia. World rapeseed oil prices also appreciated markedly, while soy and sunflower oil quotations declined.

The FAO Dairy Price Index increased by 1.5 percent from August, as solid global import demand and seasonal factors in Europe and Oceania drove up international quotations for all dairy products, especially butter.

The FAO Sugar Price Index was 0.5 percent higher from the previous month – and 53.5 percent from a year earlier – underpinned by adverse weather conditions and higher ethanol prices in Brazil, the world’s largest sugar exporter. Slowing global import demand and good production prospects in India and Thailand curbed the upward pressure.

The FAO Meat Price Index was virtually unchanged in September from the previous month and up 26.3 percent on an annualized basis. Ovine and bovine meat quotations rose due to tight supply conditions, while those for poultry and pig meat declined amid ample global supply volumes of the former and lower demand for the latter in China and Europe.



Record cereal output in 2021 still below consumption needs

World cereal output in 2021 is seen on course to hit an all-time record of 2 800 million tonnes, but that is less than the anticipated consumption requirements in 2021/22 marketing season, according to new projections in FAO’s latest Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today.

FAO now anticipates 776.7 million tonnes of wheat to be harvested in 2021, with expected higher yields in Eastern Europe and Australia offsetting weather and planting-driven output drops foreseen in Canada and the Russian Federation. The forecast for global production of coarse grains is now pegged at 1 504 million tonnes, with global sorghum and barley harvests rising faster than that for maize. World rice production is foreseen at 50 million tonnes, a new record, primarily reflecting more buoyant expectations from India’s main crop.

At the same time, world cereal utilization in 2021/22 is now forecast at 2 811 million tonnes, up 1.8 percent from the previous season, led by an anticipated significant increase in the use of wheat for livestock feed, a trend driven in part by high prices of coarse grains.

Consequently, the 2021/22 world cereal stocks-to-use ratio is expected to stand at 28.4 percent, down from 29.2 percent in the previous year, but still indicating an overall comfortable level.

The Cereal Supply and Demand Brief also includes FAO’s latest forecast for 2021/22 world trade in cereals, which points to a 0.3 percent year-on-year contraction to 473.2 million tonnes, led mostly by lower volumes foreseen for barley and maize trade.",1
796601,Why lemon prices are so high right now,"The hike in lemon prices in the UT have forced the consumers to buy vegetables that are affordable (Photo: Representational/Flickr)

The residents of Chandigarh are feeling the pinch of the astronomical surge in the price of lemons which has severely affected their kitchen budget. The price of lemons in the UT on April 25 stood at Rs 280 per kilo, burning a hole in the pockets of customers.

A host of factors such as unfavourable weather conditions, increasing fuel prices and supply shortages have triggered the hike in lemon prices in Chandigarh. The mandi supervisor in Chandigarh has attributed the surge in costs to the increasing transport costs and unfriendly weather conditions, which is putting a burden on the budget of consumers.

The price of lemons was around Rs 120 per kilo in the last week of March and by the first week of April, it had soared to Rs 240 per kilo. The prices continued to swell thereafter, and by April 10, the price of lemons hovered in the range of Rs 250 to Rs 300 per kilo in the market.

CONSUMERS COMPROMISE ON LIKING

The hike in lemon prices in the UT has forced consumers to compromise on their liking and they now have to buy vegetables that are affordable in the market.

Gurminder Singh, mandi supervisor, was quoted by the Indian Express as saying, ""Fruits and vegetables in the UT are transported from other areas as there is no local production. The high transportation costs and unfriendly weather conditions have driven the surge, which ultimately affects the life of consumers. Since fruits and vegetables are perishable items, they cannot be stocked for a longer period of time as they get spoiled in a short period of time."" (sic)

Meanwhile, the prices of other vegetables such as tomato and ladyfinger have also shot up, leading to a drop in their sales and popularity among the residents. This has given rise to unhealthy sales following lower earnings, as per a vegetable vendor.

For the past few days, the price of lemons has touched unprecedented highs in India and one kilo of lemons costs Rs 350.

799548,Rapid rise in global food prices in May,"Share this

04 June 2021, New Delhi: Global food prices rose in May at their fastest monthly rate in more than a decade, even as world cereal production is on course to reach a new record high, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations said on Thursday.

The FAO Food Price Index averaged 127.1 points in May, 4.8% higher than in April and 39.7% higher than in May 2020. A combination of factors have been attributed to the sharp increase including rising demand, production delays, disruption in harvest and supply bottlenecks. A surge in international prices of vegetable oils, sugar and cereals led to increase in the index, which tracks monthly changes in international prices of commonly traded food commodities, to its highest value since September 2011 and only 7.6% below its all-time peak.

The FAO Cereal Price Index increased 6.0% from April, led by international maize prices, which averaged 89.9% above their year-earlier value. However, maize prices started to retreat at the end of May, mostly on improved production prospects in the US. International wheat prices also showed a late-month decline but averaged 6.8% higher in May than in April, while international rice quotations held steady.

The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index gained 7.8% in May, mainly reflecting rising palm, soy and rapeseed oil quotations. Palm oil prices rose due to slow production in southeast Asian countries, while prospects of robust global demand, especially from the biodiesel sector, drove soyoil prices higher.

The FAO Sugar Price Index increased by 6.8% from April, due largely to harvest delays and concerns over reduced crop yields in Brazil even as large export volumes from India contributed to easing the price surge.

The FAO Meat Price Index increased by 2.2% from April due to a faster pace of import purchases by China, as well as rising internal demand for poultry and pig meats in the leading producing regions.

The FAO Dairy Price Index rose by 1.8% in the month, averaging 285 above its level of one year ago. The increase was led by solid import demand for skim and whole milk powders, while butter prices declined for the first time in almost a year on increased export supplies from New Zealand.",1

796472,Sugar Prices Fall As Global Supply Concerns Ease,"Share this

26 October 2022, New Delhi: March NY world sugar #11 (SBH23) on Tuesday closed down -0.02 (-0.11%), and Dec London white sugar #5 (SWZ22) closed down -1.90 (-0.36%).

Sugar prices Tuesday extended Monday’s losses, with NY sugar dropping to a 2-1/2 week low and London sugar falling to a 3-week low. Prices are under pressure on an easing of sugar supply concerns. Datagro said Tuesday they expect the global sugar market to reach a 1.8 MMT surplus in 2022/23. Last Friday, Covrig Analytics forecasted global 2022/23 sugar production would climb +4.8% y/y to 194.24 MMT, and the global sugar market in 2022/23 will be in surplus by 5.44 MT.

Higher sugar output in India is bearish for prices. The Indian Sugar Mills Association last Monday forecasted that India’s 2022/23 sugar production (Oct 1-Sep 30) would climb +2% y/y to 36.5 MMT as Indian farmers boosted their planted cane acreage by +5.4% y/y to 5.6 mln hectares. In 2021/22, India’s sugar production rose +2.9% y/y to 35.8 MMT. India is the world’s second-largest sugar producer. Also, robust sugar exports from India are bearish for prices after India 2021/22 sugar exports jumped +57% y/y to a record 11 MMT.

Signs of smaller sugar production in Brazil are supportive of prices. Unica reported Oct 11 that Center-South sugar output in the 2022/23 marketing year through September was down -9.9% y/y to 26.334 MMT. Also, Conab, on August 19, cut its estimate for the 2022/23 Brazil sugar crop to 33.9 MMT from an April forecast of 40.3 MMT, citing lower plantings and falling sugar cane yields.

In a bearish factor, StoneX on September 18 projected that Brazil Center-South 2023/24 sugar production would climb +5.7% y/y to 35.2 MMT. StoneX also projects that global 2023/24 sugar production would climb +3% y/y to 194.4 MMT on rising supplies from Brazil, India, and Thailand. StoneX predicts a 2022/23 global sugar surplus of 3.9 MMT.

This past summer’s hot and dry weather in Europe, the world’s third-largest sugar producer, caused smaller sugar beet yields and lower sugar production, which is bullish for sugar prices. Czarnikow Group predicts sugar output in the European Union (EU) and the UK should total 16.4 MMT this year, about 1 MMT lower than last year, which means the EU may have to import more sugar than usual.

796480,"Commercial LPG Cylinder Gets Cheaper by Rs 115.50; Check Rates in Delhi, Other Cities","In a big relief for consumers, oil marketing companies on Tuesday slashed the price of per unit commercial LPG cylinder by Rs 115.50 with immediate effect. This is the seventh cut in price of the 19 kg commercial LPG cylinder unit since June, in line with declining international energy prices.

The Indian Oil Corporation announced Rs 115.50 cut in the prices of 19 kg commercial LPG cylinder which brings down its price in New Delhi to Rs 1,744 from Rs 1,859.50 per cylinder earlier. One unit of the 19 kg LPG cylinder will now cost Rs 1,696 in Mumbai, Rs 1,846 in Kolkata and Rs 1,893 in Chennai (reduced by Rs 116.5).

This is the first price fluctuation in commercial LPG cylinder prices by oil marketing companies (OMCs) since the prices were last raised in May. OMCs usually announce LPG price change at the beginning and middle of each month.

Since June, commercial LPG cylinder rates have come down by Rs 610 per 19 kg cylinder. On October 1 too, the prices of commercial LPG cylinders were reduced. OMCs last month cut the price of per unit 19 kg cylinder by Rs 25.50.

This is because the rates of domestic cooking gas were way lower than cost and now with a drop in international prices, they are at breakeven, industry sources said. Commercial LPG rates, on the other hand, have largely been aligned with cost and so they have moved in tandem with rise and fall in international prices.

There is no change in the price of the 14.2 kg domestic LPG cylinder, which now cost Rs 1,053, as per the price notification from state-owned fuel retailers. On July 6, prices of domestic liquid petroleum gas cylinders weighing 14.2 kgs were raised by Rs 50 per unit. Previously, the prices for domestic cylinders were revised on May 19, 2022.

In the national capital Delhi, it currently sells at Rs 1,053 per unit. Besides, in Kolkata, Mumbai, and Chennai, it sells at Rs 1,079, Rs 1,052.5, and Rs 1,068.5, respectively.

Rates differ from state to state depending on the local VAT.

Meanwhile, CNBC Awaaz reported that OMCs may also cut petrol and diesel prices by 40 paise from November 1.

According to the report, a reduction in oil prices by 40 paise is likely to occur daily for the next five days. That will bring a total reduction of Rs 2 in petrol and diesel prices in instalments.

796866,"Vegetable Price Hike: Tomato Prices Shoot up to Rs. 60 per kg, Parwal & Cluster Beans Above Rs. 120","Public anxiety over price hikes is on the rise as vegetable costs continue to test the household budgets of the majority of families. The protracted monsoon, which destroyed agriculture and subsequent shortages of stocks has made the matter worse.

Unseasonal rainfall leading to crop failure and skyrocketing prices of fuel have led to the overpricing of vegetables in Mumbai and other metro cities. People are very upset with the price hike as it has disrupted their budgets.

The hike in food prices is creating a rift between the market and people. The increasing cost of oil and gas has only added distress to Indian farmers’ and consumers’ life.

As per media reports, vegetables costing Rs. 70-80 per kg have gone up to Rs. 120-140 per kg and have become the new retail average price for maximum garden vegetables.

Matunga is reported to be one of the costliest retail markets in Mumbai. On Tuesday, tomatoes were marketed at the price between Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 per kg in Ghatkopar, Andheri, Khar, Matunga and Borivli which were earlier sold for Rs. 40-50 per kg.

The same is the issue with other vegetables. Parwal (pointed gourd) now costs Rs 120 per kg, spinach which was previously sold for Rs 10-15 is now priced at Rs 50–60 per bunch. Cluster beans, or gawar phali, are available for Rs 40 for a quarter or kg or Rs 160 for a kg. According to sources, broccoli costs Rs. 500 per kg at wholesale market these days.

Cauliflower, which was earlier sold for Rs. 16-18 per kg is now being sold at Rs. 60 per kg in the wholesale market. Traders were earlier buying one lemon for around 50 paise- Rs. 1, are now vending out for more than Rs. 4-5 per fruit.

According to reports, many cultivators in India have experienced huge crop losses. Experts believe that food prices, which are now the highest in more than two years, may continue to rise further. The bad crop and the high costs will leave a negative impact on millions of rural people in the country.

In addition to cereals, prices for vegetables, milk, legumes and edible oils—which together make up more than 25% of the consumer price index are also growing and are anticipated to stay high for some time.",1

The JMM-led government declared 226 of the state's 260 blocks drought-affected on October 29 and decided to provide a cash relief of Rs 3,500 to each affected farmer family under the chief minister's drought relief scheme.

""The state government has submitted a financial memorandum to the Centre for assistance. We have requested a package of Rs 9,682 crore,"" state Agriculture Minister Badal Patralekh said via video conference during a review meeting with deputy commissioners and his department's officers from all districts.

According to an official, the Centre will review the state's proposal and dispatch a team to Jharkhand to assess the situation. The minister also stated that the requirement of a land possession certificate to benefit from the drought relief scheme would be removed.

""Every farmer whose name appears on the ration card data will be eligible for the scheme,"" he explained. Farmers no longer have to pay a fee of Rs 40 to apply for the drought relief scheme at common service centres (CSCs) or 'Pragya Kendras,' he said.

The overall monsoon rain deficit in Jharkhand was 20% as of September 30, and the situation was tough in the first two months of the session, which were critical for Kharif sowing, according to the official.

He said that the state's overall rainfall deficit was 49 percent in the first two months of the monsoon season this year. Jharkhand received 258.7mm of rainfall from June 1 to July 31, which was the ""highest shortfall"" since 2014, according to the Meteorological Centre.

The overall sowing of Kharif crops was 24.64 percent as of July 31 this year, according to the state agriculture department. According to the official, the state's sowing coverage was 37.18 percent as of August 15, compared to 82.07 percent in the previous Kharif season.

208,INDIA AGREES TO ALLOW IMPORTS OF U.S. PORK,"After years of U.S. prodding, India has agreed to allow imports of U.S. pork and pork products, said the Biden administration on Monday. Despite being the second-most populous nation on earth, India imports small amounts of pork at present, but U.S. farm groups believe there is great potential for sales.

�India�s agreement to allow U.S. pork imports for the first time is great news and a significant development for U.S. producers and for Indian consumers,� said U.S. trade representative Katherine Tai. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the USDA would work with India �to ensure that the U.S. pork industry can begin shipping its high-quality products to consumers as soon as possible.�

The National Pork Producers Council said the agreement would end a de facto ban on U.S. pork. �After decades of work, a market that had been closed to U.S. pork is being opened,� said NPPC president Jen Sorenson.

India accounted for $1.6 billion, or nearly 1%, of U.S. farm exports in 2021. The United States is the second-largest pork exporter in the world.

The announcement on pork imports was the culmination of a pledge between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Biden last September to develop trade and investment relationships, said Nikkei Asia. �Monday�s announcement comes two days after the duo signed a framework agreement to allow market access to the United States for Indian mangoes and pomegranates, and to India for American alfalfa hay and cherries.�",0

""There are talks between India and Egypt on the highest levels to be part of the exemptions of this decision,"" El Attar told Reuters, adding ""there's constant communication with our ambassador in New Delhi.""

India banned wheat exports on Saturday days after saying it was targeting record shipments this year, as a scorching heat wave curtailed output and domestic prices hit a record high.

The government said it would still allow exports backed by already issued letters of credit and to countries that request supplies ""to meet their food security needs"".

In April, Egypt's agriculture ministry announced it had approved India as a source of wheat supplies as the North African country seeks to supplant purchases disrupted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Egypt has been working to diversify its purchases, holding talks with France, Argentina and the United States. El Attar said earlier today that Egypt is also considering importing wheat from Pakistan and Mexico.

Last week, a plant quarantine delegation headed by El Attar travelled to India to inspect the first Indian wheat shipment headed to Egypt. The shipment was purchased by Egypt�s private sector.

According to El Attar, more than 45,000 tonnes out of 63,000 tonnes were already loaded on the ship before the export ban was announced.",0

The world's biggest producer of the fibre also removed the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) on the imports, the government said.

The total import taxes on cotton was earlier 11%, said Atul Ganatra, president of the Cotton Association of India (CAI).

Duty-free imports will help textile mills, which could import around 2.5 million bales of cotton in the 2021/22 marketing year ending on Sept. 30, Ganatra said.

""Indian mills could import cotton from Australia, Brazil, African countries and Unite States, which are supplying cotton at lower prices,"" he said.

The minister's comments came after textile mills in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, a leading exporter of garments, went on a two-day strike earlier this week demanding a ban on exports.

U.S. cotton futures prices jumped to an 11-year high earlier this month, and Indian cotton and yarn prices soon followed.

""The spinning and trading community (should) ensure hassle free supply of cotton and yarn first to the domestic industry and only surplus cotton and yarn should be diverted for exports,"" Goyal said.

Exports should not be at the cost of domestic textile industry, the largest employment generator in the country, he said.

India is the world's largest producer of cotton, with Bangaldesh, Vietnam and China its biggest buyers.

Goyal asked all stakeholders to resolve cotton and yarn price issues through collaboration rather than competition, without pushing the government to intervene as it may have long term impact on the cotton value chain.

The government has decided to form the Cotton Council of India with representatives from textile, finance, agriculture and commerce ministry. The council will hold its first meeting on May 28.

212,RED CHILLI PEPPER PRICES SURGE ON CROP DAMAGE IN TOP EXPORTER INDIA,"MUMBAI, March 7 (Reuters) - The prices of red chilli peppers are surging as output in top exporter India is set to drop by a fifth from a year ago, hit by an invasive pest attack and damage from unseasonal rain in key southern producing states.

Lower production has boosted prices by 80% in four months to a record high and prices are likely to stay high through the year, forcing overseas buyers to shell out more at a time when the prices of fuel and other food ingredients are also soaring.

""The pest attack was widespread,"" said D. Kanungo, a trader from the biggest producing state of Andhra Pradesh. ""In many areas, it forced farmers to uproot plants during the flowering stage.""

As a result, farmers fear an output drop of at least 20%, he added.

India, the world's biggest exporter of red chillis, shipped out 578,800 tonnes in 2021, up nearly 8% from a year ago.

Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the United States accounted for the bulk of its exports of $1.3 billion in 2021.

Chilli plants were badly hit by thrips and the infestation spread despite heavy use of pesticide, said Mahankal Rao, a 46-year-old farmer, who planted the crop on his two-acre farm at Guntur in Andhra Pradesh.

""For me, yields were lower, despite heavy use of pesticides, but some farmers gave up and didn't use pesticides,"" said Rao, who has been planting chillies for nearly three decades.

The invasive pest species Thrips parvispinus must be tackled quickly but many farmers abandoned affected fields, allowing it to spread, said a senior agronomist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

Farmers have now been reporting lower yields as the pest caused large-scale shedding of flowers, malformation of fruit and fruit drops, he said.

SPIRALING PRICES

Farmers have completed harvesting but are going slow on releasing the crop into the market, said Alepata Srinivas Rao, a trader based in Guntur.

""Farmers know supplies are limited and they are anticipating further price rises, so they are delaying sales,"" Rao said.

Wholesale prices in India's biggest spot market of Guntur have risen to 18,000 rupees ($234) per 100 kg from about 10,000 rupees in November.

Indian spices companies worried about supplies have been making aggressive purchases in the past few months, which also aided prices, said A.P.J. Arun, an exporter in Guntur.

But export demand will determine the price trend in coming months, said Arun, adding, ""We need to see how buyers react to higher prices.""

Though prices are high, overseas buyers cannot replace Indian chillis with those from any other origin, said trader Kanungo.

""No one has a massive surplus to replace Indian supplies,"" he said. ""And for buyers, taste is also important. Other origins don't offer the same flavour.""

Chilli production in Pakistan, another exporter, has also fallen because of erratic weather, traders said. ($1=76.9050 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav and Asha Sistla; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",0

* India's CPO imports could rise, refined could go down

By Rajendra Jadhav

MUMBAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - India has cut its tax on crude palm oil (CPO) imports to 5% from 7.5%, the government said in a notification, as the world's biggest edible oil importer tries to rein in local prices of the commodity and help domestic refiners and consumers.

The reduction in the tax, known as the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC), will widen the gap between the CPO and refined palm oil import duties, effectively making it cheaper for Indian refiners to import CPO, industry officials told Reuters.

In a separate notification, the government also said it would extend a reduction in a separate, basic customs duty on edible oils until Sept. 30. The tax reduction had been due to expire on March 31.

India imports more than two-thirds of its edible oil needs and has been struggling to contain a rally in local oil prices over the last few months.

The country imports palm oil mainly from top producers Indonesia and Malaysia, while other oils, such as soy and sunflower, come from Argentina, Brazil, Ukraine and Russia.

By Rajendra Jadhav

MUMBAI, Feb 13 (Reuters) - India has cut its tax on crude palm oil (CPO) imports to 5% from 7.5%, the government said in a notification, as the world's biggest edible oil importer tries to rein in local prices of the commodity and help domestic refiners and consumers.

The reduction in the tax, known as the Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC), will widen the gap between the CPO and refined palm oil import duties, effectively making it cheaper for Indian refiners to import CPO, industry officials told Reuters.

215,INDIA RAISES WHEAT OUTPUT ESTIMATE BUT LOCAL PRICES SURGE,"MUMBAI, Aug 17 (Reuters) - India raised its wheat production estimate on Wednesday even as other forecasters and traders were scaling down output numbers because of a heatwave.

The world's second biggest grains producer harvested 106.84 million tonnes of wheat in 2022, slightly higher than the previous estimate of 106.41 million tonnes, the government said in its latest estimate released by the farm ministry.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service has pegged India's production at 99 million tonnes, while traders estimated output fell to as low as 95 million tonnes because of the heatwave.

Local wheat prices <W-STDIDRI-NCX> jumped to a record 24,309 Indian rupees ($306) per tonne on Wednesday. That was up nearly 15% from recent lows that followed the government's surprise ban on exports on May 14, ending hopes that India could fill the market gap left by missing Ukraine grain.

The government's lower wheat procurement and rising local prices are indicating a sharp drop in production, said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.

""Its very difficult to believe in the government number of 106.84 million tonnes. Production could be around 95 million tonnes,"" he said.

India's wheat procurement fell 57% from a year ago to 18.8 million tonnes.

The south Asian country could scrap a 40% duty on wheat imports and cap the amount of stocks traders can hold to try to dampen record high domestic prices, government and trade officials said last week.

India also on Wednesday raised its rice production estimate for 2021/22 crop to 130.29 million tonnes from 129.66 million tonnes. ($1 = 79.4410 Indian rupees) (Reporting by Rajendra Jadhav; Editing by Kim Coghill)",0
216,EXPLAINER-WHAT INDIA'S U-TURN ON WHEAT EXPORTS MEANS FOR WORLD MARKETS,"SINGAPORE, May 16 (Reuters) - India's ban on wheat exports has delivered a fresh blow to world markets already reeling from tight supplies due to output issues in traditional export powerhouses Canada, Europe and Australia and snarled supply lines in the war-torn Black Sea area.

Benchmark wheat futures in Chicago jumped by their 6% limit on Monday as markets reacted to the ban announced over the weekend, igniting alarm among trading firms and importers who had been banking on millions of tonnes of Indian wheat being available for shipment over the coming months.

Below is a brief explainer on what's at stake for the world grain markets.

WHY DID INDIA BAN EXPORTS?

India was initially eyeing as much as 12 million tonnes of wheat exports in 2022/23, significantly higher than last year's record exports of 7.2 million tonnes.

After harvesting five consecutive record crops, New Delhi was hoping a sixth crop would be even higher at 111.32 million tonnes.

But a heat-wave during a crucial crop development phase dented yields, forcing the government to cut its output estimate to 105 million tonnes.

Lower output coupled with strong export demand then pushed local prices higher, often above the government's fixed procurement price.

That prompted farmers to sell wheat privately instead of to the state, whose purchases to run welfare schemes slumped due to tight supplies.

HOW IMPORTANT IS INDIA TO WORLD MARKETS?

India is the world's second largest wheat producer behind China, but rarely exports much grain due to high government-subsidized domestic prices and massive domestic food needs.

However, improved seed selection and farm management over the past decade had put the country on course for a new record crop this year, opening the door to an export boom just as global crop markets really needed extra supplies.

Indian wheat exporters had eyed sales of up to 12 million tonnes in the 2022/23 season, which would have placed India as the eight largest exporter, not far behind Canada with a projected 15.5 million tonnes.

Top destinations for Indian exports included Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and Turkey, and top global buyer Egypt recently agreed to make a first ever purchase of Indian wheat as Cairo tried to replace lost shipments from the Black Sea.

WHO ARE OTHER KEY WHEAT EXPORTERS?

Russia, Europe, the United States and Canada are traditionally the top global wheat exporters, and accounted for roughly 60% of world wheat exports from 2015 through 2020, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

However, each has faced significant wheat crop setbacks in recent seasons, with their collective export share dropping to only 50.7% in the 2021-22 season, mainly due to drought in North America and Europe.

This year's export tonnage had been expected to recover until Russia's invasion of Ukraine - a fellow major wheat producer and supplier - severed shipments from that region and sparked a scramble by major buyers to find replacement supplies.

Australia is slated to be the third largest wheat exporter this year, but suffered some quality deterioration in certain areas just before harvest and has already sealed deals on a majority of exportable volumes.

WHO ARE THE TOP IMPORTERS?

Over the last three seasons, Egypt, Indonesia, China, Turkey and Algeria have been the top five wheat importers. Other major importers include Bangladesh, Morocco, Nigeria and Brazil.

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine threatened to block wheat supplies from the Black Sea, big buyers in Africa and the Middle East have struggled to find replacements, since most alternative exporters do not begin this year's harvest until June.

The exception this year had been India, which wrapped up its main wheat harvest this month and so had a rare abundance of fresh wheat inventories.

WHAT HAPPENS NOW TO INDIA'S WHEAT?

The sudden ban on exports means a majority of the new crop will now stay within India.

Trading firms that have already secured letters of credit to export grain will be allowed to proceed with those sales.

Remaining segments of the crop that had been expected to be exported will now need to be sold or stored domestically.

Local wheat markets have already started to react to the ban, with prices falling up to 2% over the weekend in various spot markets.",0

By Naveen Thukral

SINGAPORE, Sept 9 (Reuters) - India's decision to curb rice exports is expected to lift world prices of the staple and trigger a rally rival in wheat and corn markets, deepening concerns over food inflation.

Rice prices in key exporters India, Thailand, Vietnam and Myanmar are set to rise, traders and analysts said, hitting food importers already suffering from higher costs due to adverse weather and the Russia-Ukraine war.

India banned exports of broken rice and imposed a 20% duty on exports of various grades of rice on Thursday as the world's biggest exporter of the grain tries to augment supplies and calm local prices after below-average monsoon rainfall curtailed planting.

""There is going to be substantial stresses on food security across many countries,"" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank. ""Global fundamentals could see further upside across the grains complex.""

Chicago wheat prices rose on Friday, poised for a third straight weekly gain, as India's move and talk about Russia's restrictions on Ukrainian grain shipments underpinned the market.

""This is an inflationary move for food prices,"" said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at agriculture brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney. ""This could trigger a rally in wheat and corn prices.""

India accounts for more than 40% of global rice shipments and competes with Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and Myanmar in the world market.

""Myanmar prices should go up by $50 a tonne while suppliers in Thailand and Vietnam will be quoting higher prices,"" said one Singapore-based trader.

Five percent broken rice in Myanmar was quoted around $390-$395 a tonne, free on board, before India's decision on export restrictions. In India, 5% broken white rice prices were quoted around $348 a tonne.

TOP BUYERS CHINA, PHILIPPINES TO SUFFER

The world's top rice importers China and the Philippines are likely to take an immediate hit with higher rice prices.

China, one of the biggest importers of Indian broken rice for use in animal feed, is expected to shift to corn, traders said.

""We expect import volumes will decrease with this ban...the new Chinese corn crop is coming to market soon and there are large volumes of other imported grains,"" said Rosa Wang, analyst at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd.

By Seher Dareen

Feb 17 (Reuters) - Prices of rice exported from Vietnam rose to a two-month high this week as market activity picked up again following the holidays, while low demand kept Indian rates near a one-month low.

Vietnam's 5% broken rice <RI-VNBKN5-P1> was offered at $400 per tonne on Thursday, the highest since mid-December and up from $395 a week ago.

""Prices have edged up slightly as trading activity is resuming following the Lunar New Year Holiday and demand is seen picking up,"" a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City said, adding that traders were buying moderate amounts from farmers ahead of the upcoming winter-spring harvest.

Some traders said they will be joining a tender issued by South Korea's state-backed Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp to purchase an estimated 72,200 tonnes of rice.

Top exporter India's 5% broken parboiled variety <RI-INBKN5-P1> was unchanged at $368-$374 per tonne, holding near the lowest in more than a month as demand was muted from key buyers.

""White rice buyers are shifting to Myanmar and Pakistan because of lower prices,"" said a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.

Indian farmers are likely to harvest a record 127.93 million tonnes, compared with 124.37 million tonnes the year before.

Meanwhile, rain-fed rice output in neighbouring Bangladesh is expected to rise to 15 million tonnes this year, as farmers raised acreage to cash in on higher prices and favourable weather, according to the country's Agriculture Ministry.

But despite the good crops and reserves, Bangladesh has been battling high domestic prices of the staple.

Thailand's 5% broken rice prices <RI-THBKN5-P1> were quoted at $410-$420 per tonne, up from $407-$415 last week, mainly due to a change in the exchange rate, traders said, with the baht having gained 1.7% versus the dollar from Feb. 11 till Thursday.",0
219,"INDIA'S RICE PLANTING DOWN 46% FROM LAST YEAR, LIKELY TO PICK UP","NEW DELHI, June 24 (Reuters) - Indian farmers have planted 1.96 million hectares with summer-sown rice so far, farm ministry data showed on Friday, down 46% from last year mainly due to a weak start to the monsoon.

The outlook is better, however, as the monsoon has gathered steam. Summer rains have covered more than half of the country, with the rainfall deficit getting narrowed to 2% from 36%.

The planting has just started, and the area under rice could go up with a pick-up in monsoon rains, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the All India Rice Exporters Association.

Farmers generally start planting rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, sugarcane and peanuts, among other crops, from June, when monsoon rains typically arrive in India. Sowing usually lasts until July.

Monsoon rains play a crucial role in agriculture - which employs nearly 50% of India's workforce - as nearly half of the country's farmland lacks irrigation.

The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare will keep updating the provisional crop sowing figures as it gathers more information from state governments.

The planting figures are also subject to revision depending on the progress of the June-September monsoon season.

The area planted with cotton totalled 3.18 million hectares, down from 3.73 million hectares a year earlier. Monsoon rains have been sparse over cotton-growing areas in Gujarat and Maharashtra states in the west.

Farmers have a relatively short window to complete cotton sowing and that's why rains need to pick up to help growers plant the crop.

The sowing of soybeans, the main summer oilseed crop, stood at 278,000 million hectares, compared with 1.25 million hectares at the same time in 2021.

The area planted with protein-rice pulse rose to 202,000 hectares against 132,000 hectares last year.

But pulse acreage could drop in the next few weeks as some farmers might switch to more lucrative cotton and soybean, said Nitin Kalantri, a trader based in Maharashtra.",0

221,INDIA CONSIDERING EXPORTING SOME STUCK RICE CARGOES,"NEW DELHI, Sept 21 (Reuters) - India is considering allowing the overseas shipment of some rice cargoes stuck at ports after the world's biggest exporter of the grain imposed restrictions earlier this month, a government official said on Wednesday on the condition of anonymity.

To boost local supplies and calm prices after below-average monsoon rainfall curtailed planting, India banned exports of broken rice and imposed a 20% duty on various other export types on Sept. 8.

India's move to curb rice exports trapped around one million tonnes of grain at ports.

Indian exporters have requested the government permission to ship 100% broken rice piled at ports since New Delhi banned overseas shipments of this grade.

Exporters have also requested government authorization to ship white rice stocks lying at ports without the 20% export tax, as buyers are not willing to pay the extra cost.

""We are examining it,"" the source said in response to a question about traders' requests to the government.

At least 20 ships are waiting to load around 600,000 tonnes of rice at the ports after being trapped for nearly a fortnight, forcing sellers to pay demurrage charges, industry officials told Reuters this week.

Another 400,000 tonnes of rice are stuck at port warehouses and container freight stations even though contracts are backed by letters of credit, an industry leader said.

The stuck broken rice shipments were heading to China, Senegal and Djibouti, while other grades of white rice were bought by buyers in Benin, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.

India's rice exports could fall by around a quarter this year as New Delhi's restrictions force buyers to switch to rival suppliers.",0

796860,Indian farmers can take on the multinationals,"Sharad Joshi, the well-known, controversial farm leader from Maharashtra, outlines a new strategy for agriculture.

AT A RALLY of 300,000 people in Shegaon, Maharashtra, last November, the Shetkari Sanghatana put forward a new farm programme called chaturang sheti (four-pronged agriculture). Sanghatana leader Sharad Joshi argued the economic crises and the collapse of statist development models have resulted in the state being unable to extract surpluses for industrial development at the expense of agriculture. Welcoming liberalisation as a lifting of government restrictions, Joshi insists farmers can face competition in the world market. Chaturang sheti ranges from farming for export to Sita sheti (Sita farming), which envisions women farming small plots for household consumption.

Doesn't the programme you gave for Sita sheti at Shegaon sound suspiciously like natural farming?

Why do you use the term ""suspiciously""? If the two are similar, that is a happy thing. However, any suspicions are that the two programmes, Sita sheti and organic farming, are only superficially similar. It is a fact that people all over Maharashtra and India are working for organic agriculture. We are happy about this, but there are important differences between organic agriculture and Sita farming.



While both agree that a shift away from the Green Revolution (GR) package is desirable, there is a difference in emphasis. We are neither champions nor antagonists of the GR package. In fact, we are apologists for it in the sense that we believe that in the 1960s there was no alternative. Without it there would have been massive starvation. But that period is over and we have attained some sort of food self-sufficiency.



Now, the question is: In what direction do we move? Many are talking today of replicating Punjab's Green Revolution in the eastern region, but we feel we must innovate and discover a new technology and package.



What is ""Sita farming""?

It is essentially an open-door research programme, which is entrusted to women. GR was brought in through labs supported by the government. The approach we took is that the work will be done by women, who are most interested.



We want women to experiment on their own small plots and exchange information among themselves about the rational way of production. Our approach would not necessarily be organic. There will be an investigation of all kinds of products and practices for the improvement of the produce. I think, ultimately, we'll have to evolve a rational scientific mixture of the various categories of inputs.



Why is Sita farming particularly for women?

In the search for an alternative package, a basic change in paradigm is involved and I have a feeling that most men have somehow been brainwashed into full involvement with either chemical or organic agriculture. For women, the new role will bring in a degree of confidence.



Sita has been the traditional name for the goddess, as daughter of the earth, and in the Ramayana there are many references to Sita's role. Her life, her fate, her misery, her tragedy have all become a central motif of the rural women's movement led by Shetkari Mahila Aghadi.





There has been a spontaneous evolution of idiom rather than any calculation. We found that the reaction that men and women gave to the travails of Sita was a force in itself. We are not like Marxists who don't touch anything that comes from tradition. If it's called ""Lenin sheti"", would it be good?



Why is Shetkari Sanghatana taking up this issue just now?

In the collapse of the Nehruvian model, we've achieved the goal we set ourselves a decade earlier. Agriculture is on the threshold of being recognised as a vocation, rather than a lifestyle. We've accomplished a lot in 10 years, not only with regard to remunerative prices, but also in women's rights and organic farming.



Would you say that the extreme centralisation of capital accumulation in the process of capitalism and colonialism is mainly responsible for environmental destruction?

I have one rider. There are imbalances within the Third World countries also. A number of people who claim to be champions of the Third World today are really champions of the ""Indias"" within the Third World. There is no homogeneity of interest even with regard to the environment here.



But why are all these new developments in the farmers' movement and environment movement taking place now?

The historic world defeat of a system that was supposed to be the only alternative to capitalism is one factor. The economic crunch faced by the Third World neo-colonial states is another. It is understandable that the long-subjugated, real producers try to take up some programmes like the Shegaon one. Environmentalists are largely disillusioned socialists in search of an argument that would justify statist intervention, now that Marxist economics has failed.



Possibly, something more fundamental is happening below the surface.

I am talking of those who are trying to move backwards to the old agriculture and those who are trying to mobilise farmer support against the Dunkel draft by creating imaginary phantoms. They know little of agriculture and less of agricultural developments.



Aren't these stirrings among peasants in many countries in the world, in many ways, a basis?

You are out to find similarities that don't exist. And, you are out to find differences. Well, let's talk of other aspects of chaturang sheti.



Why is processing (mazghar sheti) important and is it also connected with women?

At the present stage, yes. Agroprocessing is a very important part of the alternative pattern. While export and commerce of value-added agricultural produce is important, the Alfa-Laval method of value-adding is proving to be very expensive for the farmer as the entire benefit goes to the technology vendor and the subsidy dispenser. Therefore, we have thought of a different pattern of agroprocessing, where the product is not of western style, but of Indian origin. There, we feel nobody can compete with us. And, we do that with our own technology, respecting, of course, standards of hygiene.



But aren't multinationals in the agricultural sector trying to limit the farmer to cultivating the crop? Won't you have to fight the multinationals?

I have to fight with them, but fight with them economically. And, I'm very confident that the Indian farmer with his mazghar sheti can countenance all the competition from the multinationals. There are certain areas we can't compete in and there are certain areas they can't compete in. But we would like to one day get to the position where they are today.



What gives you this confidence?

India's position should be not to introduce artificial restrictions, but to create a situation where the introduction of subsidies and restrictions on the lines of the European Economic Community would become less and less practicable. We have to be advocating more free marketing because it's in our interests. We can sell wheat right now at Rs 300 when nobody in the world can sell it for less than Rs 600. That's the advantage we have.



Many feel it is wrong to talk of exporting food when so many are undernourished in India.

We've had undernourishment because exports are banned. If we had that kind of market availability, production would have spurted. Exports have not caused malnourishment. It's the other way around.



Do you want to remain only primary producers?

I think there are regions on the earth that are more conducive to production of biomass and there are regions that are less so. It would be wrong for a country in the tropics to produce something that is more appropriate, say, to the Scandinavian countries. You ask if some countries are always to remain primary producers? Yes, as long as the terms of trade allow biomass producers to live with the same dignity and with the same standard of living as industrial producers.



Why do you talk of vyapari sheti or commercial agriculture?

It's not commercial agriculture, it's normal agriculture. What we are proposing right now is something that is very common in all industrial societies, chain store networks and retail outlets, all of which are totally absent here. We are proposing a structure that combines farmers and consumers.



So, while almost all environmentalists and left organisations have condemned the New Economic Policy, you welcome it.

Yes. Those who can compete if trade barriers, subsidies and production restrictions are dropped, will welcome liberalisation. The Indian industrial system cannot survive without subsidies; the Bharat farmer can. Therefore, we welcome liberalisation. We only ask that the government not limit liberalisation to industry but extend it to agriculture also, so that farmers are allowed full rights to produce, to process and to sell without restriction. We also ask that the government use all its strength in favour of abolition of subsidies and lowering of trade barriers that are used at present to shore up US and European inefficiencies. As the Dunkel Draft includes primarily a programme for a phased dropping of restrictions and subsidies, we support it. We are not afraid of patents. We will patent our own seeds and crop varieties that farmers have developed over the centuries. Farmers can face the challenge of the multinationals, only if our own government does not come in the way.",0
798792,Union Budget 2022-23: Allocations skewed towards cash-schemes in agriculture,"The trend, experts said, only addresses the symptoms of the agrarian crisis and not the cause.

Cash-based agricultural schemes received almost 79 per cent of allocations in the Union Budget 2022-23, leaving only about 21 per cent expenditure for ‘core schemes’.

Budgetary allocations were heavily skewed towards cash-based schemes or direct monetary benefits in the last two fiscals as well. Investment to improve agriculture infrastructure was paltry.

The trend, experts said, only addresses the symptoms of the agrarian crisis and not the cause.

In the Union budget 2022-23, Rs 1.04 lakh crore has been allocated to just five schemes: Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN), Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), Modified Interest Subvention Scheme, Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support Scheme; and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Man Dhan Yojana. All these schemes provide cash benefits to individual farmers.

The highest share (51 per cent) among these is of PM-KISAN (Rs 68,000 crore), which provides income support by way of cash benefits to all land-holding farmers.

“The kind of long-term perspective you get when you look at the schematic approach of the budget is that the Union government is more focused on individualistic solutions,” Gurpreet Singh, senior policy analyst, Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability, told Down To Earth.

The expert added that the government’s target should have been on:

Development of community-based assets like augmentation of water resources

Improvement in soil health

Good seeds

Labs for soil testing

Handholding support

Good research and extension services

Mechanisation techniques

For these kinds of interventions, the sector is left with only 21 per cent of the entire budgetary support.

This is a sign of worry, he added. Cash-based schemes are time-bound and exclusive in nature, Singh highlighted. “PM-KISAN, for instance, leaves out landless, women farmers and tenants.”

He said: The government is targeting the symptoms of the agrarian crisis by saying if incomes are not improving, let us provide direct income support.

Cash-based schemes are okay but not when there isn’t sufficient support for other schemes that actually address the root cause, according to the policy analyst.

The Centre’s general emphasis on investment in other sectors is not visible in agriculture, said Sukhpal Singh, professor, Centre for Management in Agriculture, Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

Funds have not been earmarked for the National Agriculture Market or eNAM, an online trading platform for agricultural commodities in India, the expert pointed out. “eNam is one of the most important channels for the government to develop agriculture marketing after the repeal of the three farm laws.”

Instead of relying every time on public-private partnership (PPP) model, fiscal resources should be used in building agriculture infrastructure, Gurpreet Singh suggested.",0
798794,"Union Budget 2022-23: How will ‘Kisan Drones’ benefit farmers, experts ask","‘Spraying pesticides and fertilisers will help industries the most‘

Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced February 1, 2022 the Centre will promote ‘Kisan Drones‘ to help farmers assess crops, digitise land records as well as spray insecticides and nutrients.

Experts are sceptical about the plan and questioned what it has for the farmers. “Will it increase the farmers’ income? That’s the question nobody wants to answer,” Devinder Sharma, agriculture and food policy analyst, told Down To Earth.

Drones are not a crying need of the sector, said Nachiket Udupa, who is associated with the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. “There are bigger problems plaguing the sector that need urgent attention.”

For instance, the government set 2022 as a target for doubling farmers’ income. But there is no indication on whether it can be accomplished by this year, said Sharma.

He added that spraying pesticides and fertilisers might help but will benefit industries the most.

In 2021, the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare brought out a standard operating procedure for spraying pesticides and nutrients through drones. The document provides instructions on the effective and safe use of these flying robots.

The idea behind using drones could be to reduce human exposure to poisonous chemicals, the experts said. But considering India’s huge employment crisis, it might not be a wise move, they added.

Sharma said:

One way to make it safe for farmers is to use less harmful chemicals and organic pest management methods. That would be a better way than replacing humans with machines to do dangerous work.

Crop assessment using drones will help crop insurance companies and big farmers, according to Udupa. “The move is for the big players in the industry and not small and marginal farmers.”

The Centre had earlier envisioned using drones to digitise land records. These flying objects will survey the land, the government proposed, and officials can use the data to match with recorded information, according to the plan.

This technology, however, will not help solve property disputes, Udupa highlighted. “Instead, they will recreate the problem in the digital world.”

The digitised data could be used to build Agristak, a collection of technology-based interventions in agriculture proposed by the Centre, Udupa said.

Relying on this application, however, the government runs the risk of excluding women (if the land is in the name of the male head of the household), tenant farmers, sharecroppers and agricultural labourers from schemes.

Digitisation could also lead to privacy issues. “There is no data protection law as of now,” Udupa pointed out. The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, was tabled in Parliament December 16, 2021.

The centre has set aside Rs 60 crore for digital agriculture. At this point, it is not clear if ‘Kisan Drones’ will receive a share of it.

The government has also not clearly outlined how it plans to promote the drones, experts contested. “One does not know if the government is going to be spending money or not,” Nachiket said, adding that the government needs to provide more details.

The idea is not to ignore these technologies but use them in a manner that benefits farmers, Udupa said.

Boost to start-ups

The finance minister also said the government would promote start-ups through its ‘Drone Shakti’ initiative. It will facilitate the use of drones as a service.

Drone services is an emerging market that finds application in agriculture, construction, search and rescue, package delivery, industrial inspection, insurance and videography.

The Union Civil Aviation Ministry estimated India’s drone sector’s turnover will reach Rs 12,000-15,000 crore by 2026 from Rs 8,000 lakh in 2021.

In May 2021, during the disastrous second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, health experts dabbled with the idea of using drones to deliver vaccines to remote regions.

Select Industrial Training Institutes (ITI) in all states would provide the required skills in this area, Sitaraman added.

Drones and other sunshine industries such as artificial intelligence, geospatial systems, semiconductors, space economy, genomics and pharmaceuticals, green energy and clean mobility systems will receive attention.

The government will support these industries in building domestic capacities as well as promoting research and development. This initiative would bring academia, industry and public institutions together, experts said.

The finance minister said:

These industries have immense potential to assist sustainable development at scale and modernise the country. They provide employment opportunities for youth, and make Indian industry more efficient and competitive.

She also announced that the government will introduce a public-private partnership scheme to deliver digital and high-tech services to farmers. The initiative will involve public sector research and extensions institutions, private agri-tech players and stakeholders of agri-value chains, the minister added.

The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) would fund start-ups working in agriculture and rural enterprise sectors, Sitharaman said.

Start-ups supporting farmer-producer organisations (FPO), machinery for farmers on a rental basis and information technology-based services will be strengthened.

“Start-ups and FPO’s are the new battery of middlemen,” Sharma said about this proposal. Start-ups are getting commissions for pushing chemical inputs, he added.",0
798795,Union Budget 2022-23: Agriculture sees little cause for cheer,"Overall allocation for agriculture has risen marginally but schemes for crop insurance, MSP have seen a dip in funds this budget

Union Budget 2022-23 released February 1, saw limited focus on the agriculture sector and related policies. The overall allocation increased by a meagre 4.4 per cent for the year, even as important schemes for crop insurance and minimum support price (MSP) saw a drastic slashing of funds.

The Budget speech saw no mention of the Union government’s ambitious plan to double farm incomes, which reaches its deadline this year (2022).

The overall allocation for the sector increased marginally to Rs 132,513.62 crore in 2022-23, from the 2021-22 revised estimates (RE) of Rs 126,807.86 crore. However, the Market Intervention Scheme and Price Support Scheme (MIS-PSS) was allocated Rs 1,500 crore, 62 per cent less than Rs 3,959.61 crore in revised estimates (RE) of FY 2021-22.

The Pradhan Mantri-Annadata Aya Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA) saw an even deeper cut. It was allocated just Rs 1 crore for the year as against an expenditure of Rs 400 crore in 2021-22. Both schemes ensure MSP-based procurement operations in the country, especially for pulses and oilseeds.

The reductions come at a time when an assured MSP continues to be one of the key demands of farm unions that ended their year-long protest against the Union government’s three agricultural laws related to marketing reforms and stocking of essential commodities. The protest ended on the Centre’s assurance that a committee on MSP would be established.

“There can be two reasons for this reduction, especially in PM-AASHA. Either the government is anticipating that prices of pulses and oilseeds will remain expensive (due to the ongoing food inflation) in 2022-23 and will not be sold at MSP,” Shweta Saini, a senior fellow with the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations who researches on Indian agricultural policies, said.

“The other reason could be that it is looking to wind up the scheme — an indication that is not faring well. But the low allocation is questionable on the grounds that the government has been saying that it will procure under MSP and talking about nutrition security,” she added.

In terms of food and nutrition security, the Budget document mentions an aim to provide special emphasis on pulses and nutri cereals, beyond 2021-22, to achieve self sufficiency in these crops along with nutritional security.

However, even allocation under food and nutritionál security has come down to Rs 1,395 crore from Rs 1,540 crore in RE 2021-22.

The ‘Distribution of Pulses to state / Union territories for Welfare Schemes’ that aims to dispose pulses procured for utilisation under midday meals, public distribution system, among others, saw an allocation of just Rs nine crore.

The 2021-22 budget estimate for the same was Rs 300 crore but actual expenditure was Rs 50 crore. “This again shows that the government is not anticipating procurement and distribution of pulses at MSP,” Saini said.

In her speech, Sitharaman said 16.3 million farmers benefited from 120.8 million tonnes of paddy and wheat procurement at MSP in 2021-22. This is a reduction from the 19.7 million farmers that benefited from procurement of 128.6 million tonnes in 2021, Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan, a farmers’ union, said.

The Rs 2.37 lakh made in direct payments for the procurement is also less than the Rs 2.48 lakh crore made in 2020-21.

Poor show

Allocation for Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) or crop insurance scheme was also reduced marginally to Rs 15,500 crore for this year from Rs 15,989 crore in 2021-22. This is significant in the backdrop of a gradual fall in the number of farmers under the scheme as they do not find it useful.

Allocation to the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) increased to Rs 500 crore in 2022-23 from Rs 200 crore in RE for 2021-22. It was, however, Rs 900 crore in last year’s budget estimate.

The Rs one lakh crore AIF was announced in May 2020 as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan and was meant for spending over the subsequent six years.

However, experts said its dismal expenditure indicated poor implementation.

“Only Rs 6,627 crore worth projects have been sanctioned until now after two years and the actual disbursals are much lower at only Rs 2,654 crore. This is about 2.6 per cent only of the target (one lakh crore),” said a statement by Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture.

Boost for development schemes

One bright spot in the agriculture budget is the focus on the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) that has been losing its sheen in the last few years.

The programme has been restructured to include schemes like:

Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojna-Per Drop More Crop

Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna

National Project on Soil and Health Fertility

Rainfed Area Development and Climate Change

Sub-Mission on Agriculture Mechanization including Management of Crop Residue

These schemes were earlier a part of the Green Revolution programme. “This scheme has been running since 2007-08 and allocations had reduced over the years. But the government has resurrected it in this budget, which is a welcome step,” Saini said. She also said the scheme will give more autonomy to states and they can prioritise their spending under this.

Allocation to RKVY was Rs 10,433 crore, while RE for the Green Revolution programme for 2021-22 stand at Rs 8,852.65 crore.

Allocation under PM-KISAN, which provides income support by way of cash benefit to all land holding farmers, has also increased marginally to Rs 68,000 crore from Rs 67,500 crore last year.",0
798796,Union budget 2022-23: Big cut in fertilisers subsidy to worry farmers,"Urea subsidy cut 17%; allocation for NPK subsidy reduced 35%

Amid acute shortage of fertilisers in India, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman February 1, 2022, reduced subsidy on urea and nutrient-based (NPK) fertilisers. The move is expected to adversely hit the ailing farm sector.

The Rs 63,222.32 crore allocation for urea subsidy in her Budget for 2022-23 was 17 per cent lower than the revised estimates (RE) for 2021-22. Another Rs 42,000 crore was allocated to subsidise NPK fertilisers; that was 35 per cent below the RE.

The Centre has been reducing spending on fertiliser subsidies. The actual government spending on fertilisers in 2020-21 was Rs 127,921.74 crore. It was brought down to Rs 79,529.68 crore in the 2021-22 Union budget. This was revised to Rs 140,122.32 crore amid the farm crisis. In the current budget, it has been brought down by almost 25 per cent to Rs 105,222.32 crore.

The cuts come at a time when record fertilisers prices internationally have affceted regular supply of fertiliser products to Indian farmers. The Narendra Modi government has maintained that there is no shortage in the market, but an analysis of the Integrated Fertilizer Management System (iFMS) data from the Department of Fertilizer, Government of India for October 2021 shows a severe lack of fertiliser products, as per an article by the Economic and Political Weekly.

The country has reported several farmer protests over the shortage. Last October, farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Mahoba district had to delay sowing due to a fertiliser shortage. Five farmers in Bundelkhand region, which includes 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, also committed suicide due to the shortage. Fertiliser subsidy is a political issue in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections.",0
798797,Union Budget 2022-23: No mention of doubling farmers’ income in Sitharaman’s speech,"Omission of references to doubling farmers’ speech surprising given that 2022 is the target year for the scheme

There was no mention of the target of doubling farmer’s income (DFI) in either Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget speech February 1, 2022 or the budget documents. The omission is surprising as 2022 is the deadline for that target.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced February 28, 2016 that by the time India celebrated its 75th Independence Day in 2022, its farmers’ income would have doubled.

Last year, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said the budget of 2021-22 was aimed at achieving that target. The final budget before the deadline of the target could have been an opportunity for the Centre to outline its work under it and give an overview on the status quo.

Read DTE’s coverage on doubling farmers income

The target seems far away according to recent reports on farmers’ incomes.

The benchmark estimated annual income was Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 which was taken as a base year, according to the government’s DFI report. This comes to be Rs 8,059 per month, which was promised to be doubled in real terms, taking inflation into account by 2022.

“As such, the target income for doubling by 2022 is Rs 21,146 per month (taking inflation also into account),” a statement by Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture or ASHA, said.

However, the estimated monthly income of farm households in 2018-19 was Rs 10,218 per month in nominal terms, as the 77th round of Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households released in 2021 shows. It is nowhere near the target of Rs 21,146 per month.

“The budget was characterised by silence; earlier you had beautiful dialogues about farmers. This was the 6th year of doubling of farmers’ income. The previous five budgets had long poems about this target but now, when it was about accounting for those six years, there was silence,” said Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan.

Another crucial programme that was largely missing in its details was the government’s promotion of the organic farming scheme. Organic farming or natural farming has been listed by the government in the past as one of the activities to achieve DFI target. However, there was nothing much in the budget to that effect.

The only two points highlighted during Sitharaman’s speech in this connection were:

States will be encouraged to revise syllabi of agricultural universities to meet the needs of natural, zero-budget and organic farming, modern day agriculture, value addition and management.

Promotion of chemical-free natural farming throughout the country, with a focus on farmers’ lands in five-kilometre-wide corridors along the Ganga, in the first stage.

But there is no elaboration of this in the budget document. The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), which stresses on end-to-end support to organic farmers, has not got any allocation in this year’s budget, according to the budget document.

The only allocation towards organic farming in the budget is of Rs 198 crore towards its development in the North East region.

“The announcements related to organic and natural farming in the budget today are very small steps compared to the need of the hour and specifically after Prime minister’s appeal in December to make natural farming a mass movement,” Amit Khurana, director, Sustainable Food Systems Programme, Centre for Science and Environment, said.

Shweta Saini, who is a Senior Fellow with ICRIER and researches on Indian agricultural policies, said the government has been putting a thrust on zero budget natural farming but that thrust is not visible in the budget.

“Organic farming is diluted in the budget numbers. The document only speaks about its development in the North East region,” she said.",0

CHANDIGARH: Punjab animal husbandry, fisheries and dairy development minister Laljit Singh Bhullar said on Wednesday that the department had released Rs 76 lakh to all districts to procure medicines for prevention of lumpy skin disease among animals.

Following the reports of the spread of this disease in the border districts, Bhullar said Rs 5 lakh each has been released to Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Fazilka and Ferozepur districts and Rs 3 lakh each to the rest of the districts so that the district offices did not face any problem in purchasing required medicines. The minister asked the officials to continuously sensitise farmers, livestock farmers and the general public for the prevention of the disease.

“The state government has already issued advisory and necessary guidelines to prevent the disease and directed the officials to follow it strictly,” he added. The minister also instructed the district deputy directors to visit areas under their jurisdiction.

Singalila National Park launches programme that aims to release about 20 red pandas in a period of five years

The Singalila National Park, the highest protected area in West Bengal, will soon get new denizens. A zoo in the picturesque Darjeeling Hills has started an ambitious programme to augment the wild red panda population.

In the first re-wilding programme of red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) in India, the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park has started an ambitious programme to release 20 of these furry mammals in about five years to the forests.

The number of red pandas has been declining in the wild, even in the Singalila and Neora Valley National Parks, the two protected areas where the endangered mammal is found in the wild in West Bengal. Recent studies estimate that there are 38 of them in Singalila and 32 in Neora.

Basavaraj Holeyachi, Director of zoological park who is at the centre of the Red Panda Augmentation Programme, says conservation breeding of red pandas is only one part of the programme. Selection of animals to be released in the wild, breaking their food association with humans and tagging the animals released in the wild are crucial factors in re-wilding of the red panda population, he adds.

The Padmaja Naidu park, at a height of about 2,000 metres above the sea level, is one of the high-altitude zoos in the country and has been quite successful in captive breeding of the furry mammals. With the birth of a couple of cubs a few weeks ago, the number of red pandas at the Darjeeling zoo has increased to 27. Dr. Holeyachi told The Hindu it was the coordination zoo for conservation breeding of red pandas in the country with decades of experience. He said most other high-altitude zoos were participatory zoos that have animals given by it.

In 2021, two pairs of red pandas were released in the Singalila park. While two died, signals were received from two animals who managed to survive in the wild. The zoo director said this year, three females are likely to be released in October. Dr. Holeyachi said the whole process of selection and identification of animals to be released in the wild is time-consuming and meticulous.

“We have a conservation breeding centre at Topkey Dara in Darjeeling where cubs are kept away from human presence. We also try to break food association with humans. At Topkey Dara we make soft releases of the animals before they are actually released in the wild,” he added. The zoo director said it is important that the animals fear humans so that they can adapt in the wild. Even in the selection of animals, experts look for diversity in genetic profile, and pedigree of the animals.

“Since there are no benchmarks as far as re-wilding of red pandas born in captivity is concerned, everything is a learning experience. We have to start from scratch. The collars which are fitted on the animals when they are released in the wild are iridium collars that can give signals for 70 weeks,” Dr. Holyecahi said. Experts also point out that for surviving in the wild, the dietary pattern of animals which primarily survive on bamboo leaves, needs to change. Zookeepers are helping the panda cubs include eggs in their diet which could be available in an unprotected landscape.

Categorised as an endangered species as per IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, red pandas are shy, solitary and arboreal animals and considered an indicator species for ecological change. They are also one of the most iconic species in terms of their importance to global conservation.

A couple of recent publications by scientists of Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) have resolved the mystery around the demography and speciation in red panda. The studies have concluded that India is home to both the (sub) species — Himalayan red panda (Ailurus fulgens) and the Chinese red panda (Ailurus styani) and the Siang river in Arunachal Pradesh splits the two phylogenetic species.",0
798756,Lumpy skin disease epidemic in Saurashtra; 39 animals dead: Govt,"Government takes measures to control epidemic spread in animals; over 25,000 cattle vaccinated across affected areas

Some 1,229 cattle across five districts of Gujarat have been infected with Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), an infectious viral disease, in the past one month. Some 39 of the animals have died, according to data shared by district Panchayats with the state’s animal husbandry department recently.

Six cows have died in Kutch district, eight in Jamnagar, 21 in Dwarka and four in Porbandar, according to the data.

Read Down To Earth’s coverage of lumpy skin disease

The LSD epidemic started in Dwarka and Jamnagar districts. They are also the worst-hit.

One of the oldest cattle shelters in Dwarka is the Dwarka Gaushala, which is 135 years old and had almost 70 cows till recently.

“Half of the 70 were infected. Five died. The others have been treated and have shown improvement and have started eating. LSD-infected cows stop eating. They experience tiredness and tears flow continuously from their eyes,” Paresh Jhakharia, a volunteer at Dwarka Gaushala, told this reporter.

Symptoms of LSD primarily consist of fever, fluid excretion from eyes and nose, dribbling of saliva from the mouth and blisters on the body. The animal stops eating and faces problems while chewing or eating, resulting in reduced milk production. If an animal is pregnant, the calf dies.

Treating LSD

The administration has taken steps to rein in the epidemic. The data pointers shared by the animal husbandry department said preventive measures such as isolation and treatment of affected animals, vaccination, vector control on the premises and awareness were being taken.

“We had conducted a telemedicine session for a cow shelter in Kutch, where veterinary doctors from Karnataka and Odisha were consulted. They who advised us to prepare an Ayurvedic paste and apply it on infected cows along with administration of allopathic medicines,” Vallabh Kathiria, ex-president of the National Kamdhenu Commission and current member of the Lok Sabha from Rajkot constituency, said.

Kathiria visited a cow shelter in Kutch, where 1,000 cows are kept. He said, “There were some 12-15 cows, which had symptoms of LSD and were kept in isolation. Hence, the spread of the disease was not as intense as in other districts.”

He added that vaccines were the only cure to an LSD epidemic. Hence, substantial measures to vaccinate cattle were being taken.

Government records showed that 25,305 cows had been vaccinated till June 9, 2022.

“A vaccination drive is being carried out in a five kilometre radius across infected areas across Gujarat, in accordance with central guidelines,” a senior official from the animal husbandry said on the condition of anonymity.

Citizens are helping out too. Chaitanya Bhateliya, a local resident, gave details about LSD to residents. He also informed the authorities, whenever an infected animal died.

“Things are improving. Citizens have become vigilant. They immediately inform the authorities whenever they see an infected animal,” Bhateliya said.

“Procurement of cow milk has not been affected due to the LSD epidemic, as the impact in terms of percentage or numbers of cattle affected is not big and timely measures have helped stem the epidemic,” a senior official from the Rajkot-headquartered Mahi Milk Producer Co Ltd, said.",1
798760,India’ fodder crisis: Why cattle owners in this Haryana village want to shift to dog-breeding,"Cattle ranchers sold milch cows at throwaway prices after incurring losses of about Rs 3 lakh in 5 months

Mangatram from Lokra village in Haryana’s Gurugram district had hopes of good income when he left his job with Hero Honda 15 years ago and started dairy farming.

Initially, he fetched a good money from dairy farming, then he became a veterinary doctor. He felt that dairy farming had a future and this education would help him in his milk business and that he could take care of the animals in a better way.

Mangatram started with two buffaloes. The following year, he bought cows of Gir, Sahiwal, Rathi, Tharparkar breeds and kept increasing their numbers year after year. The going was good till the end of 2021, when he started realised that animal husbandry is no longer a profitable deal.

The sudden increase in the price of fodder forced him to move away from animal husbandry. By February-March 2022, he gradually started weaning his 39 milch cows. By the end of April, 28 cows were removed from the dairy farm.

The market price of his milch cow is Rs 80,000-90,000, but he sold most of them at Rs 5,000-7,000. He donated 10 cows free of cost to the nomadic Raika community of Rajasthan. At present, they are left with only seven adult cows, two calves and two bulls.

Mangatram, who lives in the Lokra village of Manesar tehsil in Gurugram, said that it is becoming impossible to feed animals amid rocketing prices of fodder.

This year, he has bought straw at the rate of Rs 1,500 a quintal. Last year, he got the same straw at a price of about Rs 425 per quintal. That is, within a year, the price of straw has increased more than three times.

On an average, a cow consumes 5 kilogram of dry fodder, 6 kg of animal feed and 10 kg of green fodder, according to Mangatram. This means, each meal a cow eats costs Rs 260 per day.

This does not include the cost of labour charges and medicines, which costs Rs 2,000 per cow. If we convert this expenditure per day of a cow in a year, then we will find that only about 95,000 rupees is being spent on fodder and feed.

Apart from this, there is an expenditure of Rs 24,000 in the form of medicines and labour charges. That is, the yearly expenditure on a cow is about Rs 1.19 lakh.

A cow gives 2,500-3,000 litres of milk in a year, according to Mangatram. There are two-three months of dryness in a year and during this time, the cow gives no milk.

Haryana’s Cooperative Society Vita buys milk from Mangatram at the rate of Rs 25-26 a litre. This means, he makes Rs 62,500-65,000 selling cow milk.

Mangatram was thus incurring a loss of Rs 54,000 per cow every year. It is becoming impossible for him to bear this loss, he said. His family incurred a loss of Rs 2.5-3 lakh between December 2021 and March 2022 due to the widening gap between cost and income.

Mangatram does not expect fodder to become cheaper in future. Mustard has been sown on 70 per cent of the land and wheat on the remaining 30 per cent in his village, which may be a reason for this inflated price.

If the acreage of wheat decreases and the price of mustard is high, the price of straw will not decrease in the coming five years, experts said. Straw from wheat crops is the biggest source of dry fodder and this year, due to less acreage of wheat, the prices of straw are skyrocketing in many states including Haryana.

Till a year ago, there were 450 cows in his village but at present, due to the shortage of fodder, people have sold about 300 cows, said Mangatram.

Anticipating that the situation will not be favorable in future, Mangatram is also planning to sell his remaining cows and is thinking of completely stopping the dairy farming.

He has started keeping foreign breed dogs in the dairy farm and is seriously considering adopting dog farming. He said that selling dog puppies will give better income than raising cows.",0
798769,"Over half of India’s cattle, goats, sheep and swine are non-descript: Government","New government report finds fewer indigenous individuals among these species, although experts blame non-registration of breeds as a reason

The origins of over half of India’s cattle, sheep, goats, horses, ponies, mules, donkeys and pigs are not known, according to a new report on the country’s livestock released by the government recently.

The country’s water buffaloes too have fewer purebred individuals, although its camels still have that distinction according to Breed-wise report on livestock and poultry.

The document details the breed-wise data collection that was done along with the 20th Livestock Census which was conducted between October 1, 2018 and September 20, 2019.

Livestock and poultry were counted in the exercise according to their breeds with the help of tablet computers across 0.6 million villages and nearly 89,062 urban wards.

Over 265 million households and 4.2 million non-households were surveyed across India during the 20th Census.

“The report covered 184 indigenous / exotic breeds of 19 selected species. At first, species are given codes and subsequently these codes have been extended to generate the codes for the breeds.

“The breeds which are registered by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR), were considered in the breed report. All other local breeds have been covered under non-descript category,” the document said.

Breeds with a similar phenotypic characteristic of an identified breed, were also considered. These breeds have been called ‘graded breeds’, having more than 50 per cent phenotype characteristics of an identified breed.

Some 52 per cent of cattle, which constituted 36.04 per cent of India’s livestock in the 20th census, were categorised as ‘Non-descript’. Twenty-six per cent were categorised as ‘Exotic’ and 22 per cent as ‘indigenous’.

Jersey (54.9 per cent) and Holstein (43.3 per cent) formed the bulk of exotic and crossbred cattle in India, according to the report.

There were 41 recognised indigenous cattle breeds in India, according to the 20th census. About 70.5 per cent of indigenous breeds belonged to the Non-Descript category.

“Out of the remaining 29.5 per cent, 4.8 per cent contribution is from Gir and Lakhimi breeds following which Sahiwal contribute 4.2 per cent of total indigenous cattle.

“Besides, the Bachaur breed contributes 3.1 per cent of indigenous cattle, other breeds such as Hariana, Kankrej and Kosali also contributed over 1 per cent of each of the total indigenous cattle. All other recognised breeds together contribute 8.1 per cent of the total cattle population,” the report noted.

Who has what

West Bengal had the most number of Gir cows (34.7 per cent), followed by Gujarat (25.6 per cent) and Rajasthan (15.2 per cent). West Bengal also had the most Sahiwal cows at 44.2 per cent.

Jharkhand had the most Bachaur cows at 76.89 per cent while Uttar Pradesh had the most Hariana cows at 41.5 per cent.

Some 20.3 per cent of India’s buffaloes are pure breeds, 34.3 per cent are graded and the remaining 45.4 per cent are in the Non-Descript category, according to the report.

Murrah constitute the bulk of the 13 recognised indigenous breeds of Indian buffaloes at 42.8 per cent, followed by Mehsana at four per cent and Surti at 2.2 per cent.

Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of Murrah (36.8 per cent) and Bhadawari buffaloes (87.9 per cent). Gujarat has the most Mehsana (90.3 per cent), Surti (46.8 per cent) and Jaffarabadi (69 per cent) buffaloes.

Some 50.6 per cent of Indian sheep are categorised as Non-descript, while 43.9 per cent are indigenous. Some 5.5 per cent are exotic.

The NBAGR recognises 42 indigenous breeds of sheep of which the Nellore breed constitute the most at 20.0 per cent. They are followed by Bellary, Marwari, Deccani, Kenguri and Mecheri breeds.

Deccan states such as Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are home to most populations of the Nellore, Bellary, Deccani and Kenguri breeds.

Some 63.5 per cent of India’s goats are non-descript, while 27.4 per cent are pure and 9.1 per cent are graded.

The NBGR recognises 28 indigenous breeds of goat, with the Black Bengal breed constituting 18.6 per cent of them, followed by Marwari, Barbari, Osmanabadi with 3.4 per cent, 3.2 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively.

Camels are the only major livestock species where 60.4 per cent of the animals are indigenous and 39.6 per cent are non-descript. There are nine recognised breeds of which, the Bikaneri has the highest numbers at 29.6 per cent.

KS Sivasenapathy, a breeder of the Kangeyam, western Tamil Nadu’s prized cattle breed, told Down To Earth:

I think there has been a poor application of mind. A large number of animals in India are not yet documented by the NBAGR. They are called non-descript but can be categorised as breeds in their own right.

“Evolution of breeds is an interplay of nature and culture. When you conserve cattle or any other livestock, you not only conserve a gene but also a culture. But since 2014, there has not been a single consultation by the Niti Aayog with organisations working with native livestock,” Sivasenapathy, who is the secretary of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam’s environment wing, said.

He added saving indigenous breeds was the need of the hour as in these times of climate change, hardy breeds that can thrive on scanty resources and in high temperatures were required.

“All native Indian livestock breeds should be declared as globally important agricultural heritage systems by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the Government of India should work towards this,” he said.",0

335,Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2021: FAO launches action plan 2021�2025,"The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations launched its Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) 2021�2025 on November 19, 2021.

AMR poses a particular threat to agriculture, as antimicrobials are mostly given to livestock. Misuse or overuse of antimicrobials leads to resistance, which can kill animals and livelihoods that rely on them. 

Antimicrobials are also used on crops like rice and tomatoes, as well as in aquaculture to reduce output losses.

The new plan aims to extend FAO�s capacity development assistance to its members. As resistant microbes cross borders, the report said a global effort is the only way to make sure everyone is protected.

The action plan takes a �One Health� approach and outlines several possible improvements in agricultural practices to better control AMR, from good nutrition for people and animals, vaccination, hygiene, sanitation and genetics, among other areas. 

Waste management is another important area of concern. Antimicrobials discharged by humans and animals, as well as hospitals and slaughterhouses, can enter the environment and accelerate the emergence as well as spread of resistant strains and genes. The plan calls for more AMR-related research and surveillance in the crop, aquaculture and environmental sectors.

The Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance 2021-2025 builds on the first framework, which spanned from 2016 to 2020. More than 40 low- and middle-income countries have already benefited from FAO's assistance in developing and implementing AMR National Action Plans.

It also makes resources and technical networks more accessible, and it has created a set of tools to help countries broaden their actions to include more food and agriculture sectors.

The five key objectives to help focus efforts and accelerate progress are:

Increasing stakeholder awareness and engagement
Strengthening surveillance and research
Enabling good practices
Promoting responsible use of antimicrobials
Strengthening governance and allocating resources sustainably
The availability and application of effective antimicrobials is critical for the health and welfare of terrestrial and aquatic animals as well as crop production. An interplay of factors influences the overuse and misuse of antimicrobials in animal and plant production. Which calls for action ranging from treatment failures driving production losses and food insecurity to the impacts on human health.

FAO has developed a results framework, which includes a list of indicators aligned with the five objectives and corresponding outputs and outcomes in the results chain, to assist it achieve its goals and vision. 

The results framework is intended to guide FAO programming for the next five years and it will be updated as needed to reflect progress, new challenges and available resources.

FAO will also report on AMR in relation to the sustainable development goals, both for the indicators for which FAO is the custodian as well as the other SDGs to which FAO�s AMR programme contributes.

The overriding goal of current antimicrobial resistance measures is to preserve the utility of antimicrobials, especially since the amount of food produced for people in the next 30 years will equal that generated in the previous 10,000 years combined. The plan reads, �We need to keep antimicrobials working for as long as possible to buy time for new drug discovery�.",0
339,Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2021: How rethinking communication can go a long way,"There is a famous two-line poem in Hindi which, roughly translated, says, �In the vision of a cobbler, the entire Universe is a pair of shoes�. 

To paraphrase in the context of medical professionals, �In the vision of a doctor, the entire Universe is a hospital�. 

This is a good reminder for all those trying to communicate the complex issue of antimicrobial resistance to the rest of the world, to think beyond their narrow area of specialisation, understand their audiences better and pay more attention to context.

What do patients already know, what is it that they want to know or not want to know? What is the validity of the cultural, social, economic assumptions or teaching methods that we are basing our health messaging on? How should one communicate in order to get the message across in a meaningful way?

For example, among the interventions typically suggested for lowering antimicrobial use in different settings are regulation of antibiotic sales, avoiding inappropriate use and conservation of these medicines for only those critically in need.

Behind these suggestions is the assumption that strong policies, if combined with efficient implementation, training and adequate dissemination of information, will be sufficient to achieve the objectives of behaviour change needed to lower antibiotic use.  

This is a classic top-down approach, where the experts believe their pronouncement of the truth will automatically lead to behaviour change. However, it cannot be assumed that any one conception of �health�, �disease� or �medicine� � even if it is the most �rational� and �evidence based� � should necessarily be accepted by the vast and diverse populations of the world. 

The infant, the young, the elderly, the men, the women, the rich, the poor, the indigenous, the urban and the rural cannot all be put in the same petridish to be examined under a lens with the hope of arriving at one general formula for intervention.

There is simply too great a diversity of health-seeking behaviour out there for such one-size-fits-all formulas to work effectively.

Worldwide, there are many examples of interventions failing to make any impact or certainly being well below optimum in their results due to lack of understanding of cultural context.

The Union Ministry of Health in India, for instance, started a �red line� campaign a few years ago to warn about the use of antibiotics without prescriptions. Under this campaign, there is a red colour line drawn on the packaging of antibiotics whose use comes under the highly restricted category. 

The problem though is that �red� is not a colour that signifies danger or serves as a warning in much of the Indian context. On the contrary, it is seen by large sections of the Indian population as an auspicious colour � used to mark positive events or objects. Indian women, and those around South Asia, wear red �bindis� on their foreheads as part of tradition. 

Surely, they are not a sign of impending danger! (Maybe this cultural fact is also one of the reasons why most Indian drivers refuse to stop their vehicles when the signal turns red!)

In the field of health communication in particular, the knowledge of cultural markers, beliefs and practices are essential. This is because, beyond their biological functions, medicines take on other meanings and roles in different arenas. 

Anthropological studies in many societies around the world have shown how medicine is also historically associated with magic and faith, rendering them often beyond the pale of facts, evidence-based discussions and �rational� prescriptions. 

Again, much of the inappropriate use of antibiotics, whether in the human or health sector, is also driven by various powerful structural factors, particularly economic ones. 

Unfortunately, the modern medical system, supposed to be based on sound principles and evidence, is heavily influenced by the quest for  monetary profits by sections of the medical and drug industry.

The lure of money is such that sometimes regulators, practitioners and researchers are willing to tailor their policies, prescriptions and findings to suit the needs of the market, compromising even the science of modern medicine. 

Similarly, the relation between doctors and patients or the public is a complex one and not entirely reducible to a simple equation of a health professional interacting neutrally with a health-seeker. There is money involved in this transaction too, which makes objectivity even more difficult. 

Getting beyond all these confounding factors and still communicating effectively about the different dimensions of AMR is not an easy task.

However, it is a challenge worth undertaking given the severe consequences for everyone, as we saw in the case of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), if this phenomenon is allowed to spread unchecked.

340,Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2021: Antibiotic use trends in Mozambique�s veterinary sector and efforts to contain it,"In recent years, the growth and expansion of veterinary activity has been verified throughout Mozambique. This came with the consequent proliferation of establishments that provide veterinary assistance services as well as the sale of veterinary medicines and products due to the increase in livestock numbers, particularly the poultry farming area by the family sector.

This sector has limitations in the observance of Good Production Practices, from the point of view of biosafety in its facilities. Thus, the occurrence of infections is frequent, which requires the use of antibiotics.

The authorisation for the entry of medicines for veterinary use in the country is preceded by the registration of the company at the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and application for an import license at the Veterinary Authority. The import of Veterinary Medicines is done by the private sector, following the requirements set out in the specific legislation.

The main international companies supplying pharmaceutical products to Mozambique are Aviourem Specialities Pharmaceuticals, Bayer, Bupo Animal Health, Interchemie Werken, Intervet, Kepro, Kyron Laboratories and MSD Animal Health. 

Most imported antibiotics come from the Netherlands, India, Argentina, South Africa, France and China.

The active principles of the most imported antibiotics are oxytetracycline hydrochloride, sodium sulfadianine, doxycycline hyclate, erythromycin thiocyanate, tylosin tartrate, sodium sulfaquinoxaline, streptomycin sulfate, penicillins and enrofloxacin. All of them are intended for animal use. Oxytetracycline hydrochloride is imported the most.

Regarding antibiotic classes, the largest import is made up of the group of tetracyclines, sulfonamides, penicillins and macrolides.Efforts to contain use

The country has normative instruments aimed at the control and prudent use of antimicrobials, some of which are in force and others still awaiting approval by competent authorities.

1. National form of veterinary medicines

It is a normative instrument that describes essential veterinary products, designated by the following: 

Generic names or international common denomination
Recognised pharmacological classification
Active principles
Route of administration
Indications of the target species
Dosage
Contraindications
Side effects 
Other important information for the knowledge of users.
Its purpose is to serve as a practical tool for consultation by professionals with a view to the correct administration of drugs to animals.

In general, only medicines, including antibiotics, mentioned in the National Form of Veterinary Medicines may be authorised to be manufactured, imported, distributed and sold in the country. Currently, this form, dated 1986, is in the process of being updated.

2. National action plan against antimicrobial resistance (AMR)

The plan was developed following the �One Health� approach, a multi-sectoral effort among the areas of human, animal, environment, fisheries, agriculture, academic and research institutions, professional associations and cooperation partners.

The vision is to ensure the rational use of antimicrobials in humans, animals and reduce the presence of antimicrobials in the environment. This plan has six strategic interventions to control AMR, through improvement in both prevention and access and use of antibiotics for humans and animals:

Improve awareness and knowledge of AMR, and educate public and animal health professionals
Reduce the incidence of infections through effective vaccination, sanitation, hygiene and prevention as well as infection control
Strengthen knowledge through surveillance, and ensure sustainability through funding and research
Improve access to antibiotics to treat infections
Optimise the use of antibiotics in human and animal health
Change incentives that anchor the overuse of antibiotics and enforce their rational use
An important aspect for the reduction of indiscriminate use of antibiotics is to systematically and continuously strengthen the training of animal health professionals in AMR matters, with an emphasis on antibiotic administration programs combined with rapid diagnostic technologies. It is also important to invest in the vaccination of livestock and in the prevention and control of infections to reduce the consumption of antibiotics.

3. Animal health regulation

In compliance with this regulation, the use of hormones and growth promoters in animal production, including antibiotics, is prohibited.

4. Regulation of drugs, medicines and veterinary products proposal

It provides for aspects related to dispensing, which assumes that drugs, medicines, including antibiotics and veterinary products subject to veterinary prescription and intended for farm animals, can only be dispensed to the public with a veterinary prescription.

Other government efforts

In order to ensure greater technical guidance to breeders who buy medicines, all establishments that sell veterinary medicines, including antimicrobials, must have a technical director, a veterinarian, registered in the veterinary statutory body of Mozambique. 

A One Health Platform was established in the country, with two working groups � one for zoonosis and the other for AMR.. The AMR group is composed of three sub-groups: Prevention and control of infections; optimization of the use of antimicrobials (stewardship); resistance to antimicrobials.

371,"Over 40,000 Pigs Died Of African Swine Fever In Assam Since 2020: Minister","Guwahati: More than 40,000 pigs have died of African Swine Fever in Assam since its detection in the state in early 2020, Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Minister Atul Bora said on Tuesday.
Over 14,000 families have been economically affected as a result of the pig deaths and the disease has spread to 22 districts, the minister told a press conference here.The African Swine Fever (ASF), which was first detected in the country in Assam in February 2020, affects both domestic and wild pigs.

While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, ASF cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans.

Around 900 pigs have died since January 2022 mainly due to the massive flood this year, the minister said.

""This is a deadly disease and the mortality of pigs is 100 per cent. At present 22 districts of Assam having 72 epicentres are affected by ASF. Since March 2020, 40,482 pigs have died of ASF affecting 14,005 pig farming families,"" Bora said.

The government culled 1,378 pigs spread across 27 epicentres to contain the spread of the disease in the north-eastern state, he added.

In September 2020, former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal ordered the culling of nearly 12,000 pigs in the ASF-affected areas and asked officials concerned to compensate the owners adequately""We have also launched a compensation scheme for the affected families and the government has so far spent ? 1.48 crore to compensate the farmers whose pigs have been culled,� the minister said.

As per central rules, there is a provision for paying compensation based only on the culling of ASF-affected pigs, Bora said.

He also said that the pigs are culled within three days after the spread of ASF to a particular location and compensation is paid to the farmer within 10 days.

""A high-level committee has been formed to monitor the situation and take adequate measures. As of now, the sale of pork is banned in Tinsukia and Sivasagar districts, having all the epicentres,"" Bora said.

The government has formed 427 rapid response teams and launched an extensive awareness drive to sensitise the pig farmers against the spread of the ASF, he added.The minister also stated that to revive the pig farming sector, a series of programmes had been planned in association with International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and Office International des Epizooties (OIE).

A pig processing centre with a daily capacity to process 400 pigs was ready at Nazira in Sivasagar district.

However, it could not be inaugurated due to the sudden outbreak of the ASF in the region, the minister said.

The state produced 20.88 tonnes of pork in 2020-21 which meets only 60 per cent of the consumption demand. The rest comes from outside the Northeast region, Bora said.

The pig population in the state is estimated to be around 20 lakh, excluding the wild boars roaming in different forests, he added.",1
798960,Roots of health: How a simple processing method helps turmeric farmers earn more,"Minimum processing would ensure that the benefits of turmeric are retained

Indians consumed more turmeric in 2020 hoping to benefit from its antiviral properties, as the reality of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic dawned on them.

Other than cooking with it, people consumed it in the form of kadhaa. From vegan turmeric lattes to chia turmeric cookies and detox teas, the variety of products in the market has increased during the lockdowns.

However, before the turmeric powder reaches consumers, the underground stems or rhizomes of the Curcuma longa plant goes through a long and cumbersome method of processing. The rhizome is cleaned, boiled for 45 minutes to one hour, dried for 15-20 days in the open and then polished.

During this, the rhizomes lose as much as 30 per cent of the volatile products and get dirty from being in the open for so long.

Harish BS, an assistant professor (spices and plantation crops) at the University of Horticultural Sciences, Bagalkot as well as its college in Bengaluru, has a simple alternative to this process. “The rhizome can be cleaned, sliced with a potato chip maker and then dried in the sun. It takes just eight hours for the chips to dry,” explained Harish.

Minimum processing ensures the benefits of turmeric are retained, he added.

Rhizomes processed using this method have more curcumin than the ones processed by the traditional method, found scientists at the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore. The raw rhizomes had 6.36 per cent curcumin and the boiled stems had only 4.64 per cent.

CFTRI has a similar technology for processing turmeric but this involves equipment which is expensive and out of reach of the common farmers.

Shree Padre, a Kerala-based journalist who has worked extensively in promoting jackfruit and banana, said:

The slices would have a reasonable shelf life as turmeric is a traditional preservative. It would be difficult to adulterate these chips.

The conventional process of turmeric processing is polluting too.

The family of Nagarjun Kumar SM, a PhD scholar who works on climate change mitigation at University of Mysore, owns a 30-acre turmeric farm in Shivpura village in Gundulpet taluk of Chamarajanagar district, Karnataka. He wanted to do something to reduce the carbon load in the environment.

Around 20 tonnes of turmeric is produced per acre of land under good cultivation practices. “To boil this much turmeric under conventional processing, you need to burn around three-five tonnes of dried turmeric leaves along with twigs and wood that need to be purchased,” he calculated.

Some 40,000 acres of land is under cultivation in the district and would require some 100,000-200,000 tonnes of dry leaves as kindle, he adds. This can cause significant pollution.

Moreover, turmeric leaves can be used to extract commercially viable compounds. They are traditionally used as food — in curries, pickles — in Kerala and Goa and to wrap fish and sweets during the cooking process. This gives a mild fragrance to the cooked food.

He decided to experiment with Harish’s method and processed around 250 kilograms of turmeric. While the rhizomes sell for just around Rs 100 per kg, Nagarjun could sell the powder prepared in this way for Rs 300-350. “This was an easy doubling of income,” he said.

The next crop would be ready for harvest in December. He plans to produce 1,000 kg of turmeric powder and slowly scale up.

Nagarjun has registered a company called Bandipur Naturals Agrifarms Pvt Ltd and markets the product through social media and word of mouth. “Production is not a problem, marketing is. And marketing at a good price is very much a problem,” he said.

As the demand for this “elixir” increases globally, this problem is likely to be resolved easily.",0
799050,Hazards of using fertilisers in Punjab,"Studies have pegged consumption of phosphatic fertilizers in Punjab at ten times higher than the national average

The media has consistently reported on cancer deaths in the Malwa region of Punjab. While a definite scientific finding on the same is awaited, there have been varying conclusions which may, at best, be speculative in nature.

But first, it is important to bring out facts which are uncontested. Studies have pegged consumption of phosphatic fertilizers in Punjab at ten times higher than the national average. For potato, the national average of consumption is 15-20 kg per acre. In Punjab it is 200 kg per acre.

Similarly, for paddy fields, the consumption is 75-100 kg per acre as compared to the national average of 10 kg per acre.

Pursuant to the disquieting reports from the area, Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in 2013 analysed fertiliser and soil samples from the Malwa region and discovered heavy concentration of Uranium. This was specific to the phosphatic fertilizer (DAP or Diammonium Phosphate).

According to the report, Uranium concentration in DAP was around 91.77 parts per million (ppm), which was way beyond the permissible limit.

The total fertilizer consumption in India is 27 million tones, out of which about 20-25 per cent of phosphorous and nitrogen-based nutrients are dependent on imports from the United States, Jordan, Iran, Oman, China, Russia, Morocco, Israel, Lithuania and Egypt.

It is also a fact that the fertiliser industry in India does not follow all procedures and protocols essential for decontamination of imported phosphatic rock associated with traces of Uranium.

On the other hand, fertiliser industries in the US and Israel, ensure complete decontamination before use. It is understood that the decontamination process, which is expensive, is not taken into consideration by the domestic industry.

There is yet another theory which does not support the fertiliser route for Uranium ingestion through food chain, but emphasises on the geogenic factors for the possible presence of Uranium in the groundwater samples.

Presence of Uranium is widespread, and according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, its normal concentration in soil is between 300 microgram per kg (ug/kg) and 11.7 milligram per kg (mg/kg).

Higher concentrations of Uranium are present in certain types of soils and rocks, especially granite. All the three isotopes of Uranium (U-234, U-235, U-238) have a half-life period ranging from 0.25 million years to 4.47 billion years, indicating their relative stability.

The association of Uranium 238 in certain types of bedrock strata, coupled with a humongous half-life period leads to its high natural concentration in water. Such occurrences have been reported from Finland, Norway, Canada, USA and Greece.

In the Indian context, contamination of Uranium in Punjab’s groundwater has been a problem since the early 2000s. High levels of uranium found in the fertile Malwa region along with industrial effluents leads to a bigger problem as it contaminates the ground water.

The presence of bicarbonates, nitrate, chloride anions and soil is calcareous, since the carbonic acid created in the process enhances leaching efficiency of uranium from soils and sediments.

With no guidelines or acceptable standards by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) regarding amount of uranium in fertilisers produced in India, we are on a dead track. Authorities concerned need to take cognisance and invest in less expensive R&D of the decontamination process.

At the same time, it is also necessary to specify the acceptable limit of Uranium in ground water.",0
799179,The curse of plenty,"If Kerala can't solve its water problem, who can?

THE steady downward trend of rainfall in Kerala for the past five years went unnoticed. The rapid fall in groundwater, too, didn't raise eyebrows. With 44 rivers and an annual average rainfall of 3,000 mm, Kerala goes to sleep with sweet dreams of water all around. But in February 2004, the state woke up with a bad dream. A drought in Kerala is shocking news, as is suicide by 11 farmers in Wayanad district (since April 2004). The state government claims a loss of Rs 2,844 crore due to drought. Farmers have to make additional investment to deepen borewells, with the water table touching the depth of 250 metres in some places.



This epitomises our polity's lack of foresight. Modern society has a bad habit of reaching for the last bit of resource very easily, assuming that additional capital investment will bring more of it. Kerala has reached for the last drop all too quickly. A sense of plenty has wreaked havoc, high literacy and science education notwithstanding. Since 1956, the state has spent Rs 3,245 crore on irrigation projects to service large-scale paddy cultivation. But the area under paddy has declined by more than 50 per cent area in the last 46 years. This excessive investment on irrigation hasn't helped the drinking water crisis. In Kerala, paddy helps recharge groundwater. So the loss in paddy area is opportunity lost in groundwater recharge too. Nobody's studied if the decline in rainfall is linked to a long-term metereological change. There is no sign of public research to find out how Kerala can manage its rainfall endowment.



It took a conflict with a soft-drink manufacturer to reveal the severity of groundwater extraction in the state. Excessive sandmining is also causing public protests -- experts fear that all sand in seven rivers in Greater Kochi region will be over in decade. But a powerful nexus wins over the science of riverflow.



It seems that all the science movement and education drive has gone to waste in Kerala. And its hourglass has no sand anymore.",0
796700,We can contain the pest',"India's temperature and atmospheric conditions are ideal for the spread of Fall Armyworm

We visited Karnataka's Chikballapur district after several farmers complained of a pest attack. Initially, we thought the farms were attacked by True Armyworm, or Mythimna. We collected samples from the farms that were severely affected. The findings showed that the farms were infested with Fall Armyworm. Unlike True Armyworm, a Fall Armyworm (FAW) larva has an inverted Y-shaped marking on its head and four dark spots that form a square towards the end of its body. A fully formed true armyworm moth is straw coloured, while a FAW moth is darker. It is also more dangerous than true armyworm. Once the plant is infected by FAW, it cannot be saved, as the pest hatches its several generations in the plant's lifecycle. The worm also attacks several parts of the plant. The larvae scrape the surface of the leaves, making them papery. They also eat plant shoots. So, new leaves open up with big punctures on them.



India's temperature and atmospheric conditions are ideal for the spread of FAW. In fact, a single female moth can lay up to 1,500 eggs when the temperatures are between 15 and 30OC. It can also fly great distances, which aids its spread. We are currently collecting samples to conduct molecular analysis that will help us ascertain how it has entered the country. The analysis will also identify the exact strain of the pest. The initial assessment will take at least another two months and the complete analysis will take over a year. So far, the armyworm variety that eats rice has not been found in India.



We are recommending farmers to use Emamectin Benzoate (0.4 grams per litre of water) in places with severe infestation. Neem formulations can be used in places with mild infestation. India can control the pest through timely management practices as it has not reached Africa levels.

796712,New research sheds light on role of copper-dependent enzymes in plant infection,"Share this

14 August 2021, UK: Crop pathogens like Phytophthora infestans – the origin of several European potato famines in the 19th century – still cause US$300bn worth of damage to global crop production each year and continue to threaten world food security.

Researchers at the James Hutton Institute and the University of York, working alongside colleagues in France, Saudi Arabia and the UK, have identified previously unexplored ways in which P. infestans breaks through plant cell walls, opening up opportunities for the development of effective and sustainable disease control technologies.

Also Read: Belarus Tractors paved way into Indian market

The research, published in the prestigious scientific journal Science, describes how a family of copper-dependent enzymes is present in P. infestans, promoting its ability to degrade pectin – a key component of plant cell walls – and enabling the pathogen to break through the plant’s defences. By silencing the gene responsible for producing these enzymes, researchers could inhibit the infection of potato plants.

Dr Steve Whisson, a molecular biologist at the James Hutton Institute’s Cell and Molecular Sciences department, said: “There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underpinning successful host invasion by these pathogens.

“Penetrating the plant cuticle and cell wall is the first step in infection, and the cell wall represents the site of the major struggle between host and pathogen . Working with colleagues at the University of York, we have discovered an unexplored mechanism in which P. infestans weakens the plant cell wall during the early stages of infection.”

Dr Federico Sabbadin, from the University of York’s Centre for Novel Agricultural Products (CNAP), said: “These new enzymes appear to be important in all plant pathogenic oomycetes , and this discovery opens the way for potentially powerful strategies in crop protection”.

Professor Simon McQueen-Mason, also from CNAP, remarked that the work was “the result of interdisciplinary collaborations between biologists and chemists at York along with plant pathologists at the James Hutton Institute, and genomicists at CNRS, with invaluable molecular insights from Professor Neil Bruce (CNAP) and Professors Gideon Davies and Paul Walton in the Chemistry Department at York.”

The project New Enzymatic Virulence Factors in Phytophthora infestans is a collaboration with the University of York, running from 2021 to 2025, and is supported with a £1m grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

The James Hutton Institute’s Cell and Molecular Sciences (CMS) department is based in Dundee and comprises more than 100 plant scientists with research specialisms in cell and molecular biology, genomics, genetics, pathology and physiology.

A major research focus for CMS is on the genetic improvement of cereals, potatoes and soft fruit crops with respect to yield and quality, resource use efficiency and pest and disease resistance.",0

","NEW YORK: Scientists have developed a novel hand-held device that can quickly capture and identify various strains of virus.

Virologists estimate that 1.67 million unknown viruses are in animals, a number of which can be transmitted to humans, according to the study published in the journal PNAS.

Known viruses, such as H5N1, Zika and Ebola have caused widespread illness and death.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that early detection can halt virus spread by enabling rapid deployment of countermeasures.

""We have developed a fast and inexpensive handheld device that can capture viruses based on size,"" said Mauricio Terrones, a professor at Penn State and New York University (NYU) in the US.""Our device uses arrays of nanotubes engineered to be comparable in size to a wide range of viruses. We then use Raman spectroscopy to identify the viruses based on their individual vibration,"" Terrones said.

This device, called a VIRRION, has a wide range of possible uses, the researchers said.

For example, early detection of a virus in the field can save farmers an entire crop. Early detection of a virus in livestock can also save a herd from illness, they said.

Hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the floods are living in the open, and as floodwaters - spread over hundreds of kilometres - may take two to six months to recede, stagnant waters have led to serious health issues.


With Pakistan's already weak health system and lack of support, displaced families have complained of being forced to drink and cook with disease-ridden water.

""Considering there would be a substantial increase in production of genetically modified (GM) crops, the companies will therefore have to target newer non-GM crops to increase pesticides usage,"" Kapoor said.

The pesticides industry in India is estimated at about Rs 17,000 crore and is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of about 15 per cent.

621,FOLIAR CORN DISEASES RISING,"The wet, cool spring that hampered many farmers' efforts to get their crops planted this spring are again coming back to bite them, this time in the form of the threat of foliar diseases that could inflict damage to the growing corn crop.

Purdue University Extension plant pathologist Kiersten Wise says she's hearing reports of field conditions rife for the development of a trio of potentially yield-robbing diseases: Gray leaf spot, northern corn leaf blight, and Goss's wilt, according to a university report. The fungal gray leaf spot and Northern corn leaf blight are being seen in the lower canopy of susceptible fields, while Goss's wilt has been found in both popcorn and hybrid field corn around Indiana, Wise says. This year's delayed planting has a lot to do with why the diseases are so prevalent thus far this summer.

""Many fields across Indiana are currently at a younger growth stage than normal due to delayed planting and, therefore, may be at greater risk for yield loss due to disease development,"" Wise says in a university report.

Gray leaf spot and Northern corn leaf blight, since they're both fungal, can be controlled with a fungicide application during tasseling and early silking. Just be sure to scout closely first to determine if a treatment is warranted. Goss's wilt is a different story. Fungicides won't work, so if you're seeing damage from it now, you may be stuck with it and relegated to planning ahead to next year unless a bactericide can be leveraged to control the disease.

""Fields with confirmed Goss's wilt should be planted to a hybrid that is more resistant to Goss's wilt in subsequent years,"" Wise says. ""Tillage and crop rotation will also help reduce the amount of residue that can harbor bacteria for the next corn crop.""

But with other foliar diseases, control is certainly possible. Just be sure of where you sit regarding infection levels, potential economic damage, and weather conditions before you pull the trigger on a treatment strategy.

""Before deciding on in-season management of any foliar disease, consider threshold guidelines, cropping practices, planting date, predicted weather conditions, and economic factors,"" Wise says. ""And manage expectations for what type of yield response an in-season fungicide or bactericide application will provide.""",0
622,SOYBEAN DISEASES EXPLODE,"Cool, wet growing conditions this year have increased disease pressure in some soybean fields, cutting into yields and crop quality. While this season will soon be history, lessons learned from 2009 can help growers better select soybean varieties to combat diseases for next year to maximize yields, say experts from Pioneer Hi-Bred, a DuPont business.

""Heavy disease pressure has been reported this year in fields to diseases such as white mold, soybean cyst nematode (SCN) and brown stem rot (BSR),"" Pioneer senior marketing manager for soybeans Don Schafer says in a company report.

According to Schafer, white mold has been reported across most states in the northern Corn Belt including Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa and Nebraska. A sporadic disease that does not have widespread incidence every year, white mold can survive up to 10 years in soils, necessitating more than just rotation with nonhost crops like corn, sorghum and small grains.

""2009 is one of the heaviest years for white mold we have seen in the past 10 years,"" Schafer says.

Brown stem rot surfaced in areas where it's common, like northern Illinois, northern Indiana, southwest Michigan and southern Minnesota. But, it's also showing up in atypical areas such as northeast Nebraska and South Dakota.

Schafer reports other diseases like sudden death syndrome (SDS) are afflicting new areas as well.

""We're also seeing SDS pressure in new places,"" Schafer says. ""The geographies impacted by SDS have expanded this year, with the disease moving both west and north.""

As one of the most destructive soybean pests, SCN infestations pose another chronic threat to crops. Annually, SCN costs growers more than $1 billion. Effectively managing nematodes requires scouting, sampling and rotating crops and using sources of SCN resistance. To complicate matters, the presence of SCN can cause further stress in fields already plagued with BSR or SDS. Selecting the right combination of genetics, agronomic and defensive traits with specific seed treatments will help set the stage for growers to have a successful soybean crop.",0
624,KNOW YOUR SOYBEAN DISEASES,"You�ve seen those big brown patches in soybean fields in August, where the plants die early. It�s sudden death syndrome (SDS), right?

Not so fast, says Dean Malvick, University of Minnesota Extension plant pathologist. Yes, SDS gets much of the attention and is probably still growing in severity across the Midwest. Still, those brown patches may be caused by several diseases, including a soilborne fungal disease that has fallen off some radar screens in recent years: brown stem rot (BSR).

�It was first identified in Illinois in the 1940s,� says Malvick. �It got a lot of attention in the 1960s to the 1990s, but not so much now. Much of the recent research has gone to sudden death syndrome.�

That doesn�t mean that BSR has gone away. A recent survey in the Midwest pegged BSR as present in 70% of soybean fields. Yield losses associated with the fewer pods and smaller beans has been up to 27% for the entire field, although 10% to 15% (or at least 5 bushels an acre) is probably more common, says Malvick.

SPLIT THE STEM
People often confuse BSR and SDS (along with some others) because they are both caused by fungi that linger in crop residue and soil. Both can show similar symptoms when patches within a field begin to die and turn yellow early. Sometimes, even a close-up inspection of the leaves can be confusing. (See photo.)

To know if it is BSR, split the stem of an infected plant near its base, Malvick says. �Inside the stem, you will see the brown rot in the pith that tells you it is BSR,� he says. SDS and other diseases produce no such rot.

BSR thrives in cool and wet soils during the plant�s reproductive stage. The fungus carries over especially well in old soybean crop residue, so rotating crops helps. Still, Wisconsin scientists found that BSR can survive for 2� years on surface residue, but just one year if it�s buried.  

�You will usually see a BSR outbreak after podding in August,� says Malvick. �It was likely there all along � since May or June � but it was sort of latent until erupting in August.�

Malvick wonders if BSR is showing up as a culprit more frequently now because of weather changes (wetter and cooler), or possibly the fungus has changed. 

�We see two types of BSR,� he says. �Type A is more aggressive, and it always shows symptoms on the leaves with the early browning. Type B is more common now. It�s a little milder. Often Type B has no leaf symptoms at all. Both types can produce yield losses of 10% or more.�

So what can you do? Crop rotation helps and perhaps modest tillage. Delaying soybean planting in the spring can also reduce BSR severity later in the season, Malvick says. However, weigh this against reduced yield potential from delayed planting.",0
625,MANAGING SOIL DISEASES,"Once you've had a soil-bourne disease present in your field, it's likely going to be there for a long time. But, whether they continue to cause crop damage depends on how you manage specific conditions each year, one expert says.

""Managing diseases starts with knowing what is present in the fields,"" says Purdue University Extension plant pathologist Kiersten Wise. ""Growers need to know what diseases have shown up in their fields in the past, and they need to plan for those diseases even if they haven't seen them in a few years.""

Environmental conditions, planting date and seed variety planted all go into the prospects a disease returns at harmful levels in the future. So, keeping track of those variables and managing them in the future is crucial to keeping soil-bourne disease pressures are kept at bay.

""Soil diseases don't go away, so growers need to plan to manage them,"" Wise says. ""Knowing the field history can help growers choose varieties that are resistant to previous disease pressures.""

If you're planting corn into soils where soil diseases have been present in the past, consider planting later on in the season if possible. And, consider adding at least one disease treatment during the growing season.

""Foliar disease organisms won't be as affected by the mild winter. Instead, they will depend more on the weather during the reproductive stages, probably in July,"" Wise says. ""At that point, if growers are seeing foliar diseases, they can consider fungicide treatments.""

And, don't forget to take into account your production system and its influence on disease management. Namely, if you're planting into a no-till field, you may need to pay closer attention to crop residue than you normally would to prevent soil disease from flaring up.

""If farmers are planting into fields with a lot of residue, if they're planting susceptible varieties and if their fields are continuous corn, they could possibly benefit from a fungicide later in the season if the environment is favorable for disease development,"" Wise says.",0
626,FOUR STEPS FOR SCOUTING SOYBEAN DISEASES,"It's not always possible to control field crop diseases when you find them, says Carl Bradley, University of Illinois Extension plant pathologist.

Still, it pays to scout. Taking notes on disease-stricken fields can help when it comes to variety selection. Although it's too late to curb some diseases once you find them, you can help prevent them the next time you plant soybeans by selecting resistant or tolerant varieties.

Plus, there are some diseases growers can control in-season by applying fungicides. Field scouting and watching weather forecasts can aid growers during the fungicide decision process. Although a few fungicides have some ""curative"" properties, they all work better when applied at the beginning stages of disease, says Bradley.

Here are four disease scouting tips to keep in mind during field scouting this season.

Check soybean emergence early.
If stand losses and seedling diseases are a problem, consider using a fungicide seed treatment or choosing a variety with good seedling vigor the next time around. Send diseased seedlings to a plant clinic or diagnostic lab for determination of the causal agent. If Phytophthora root rot is the cause on soybean, plant a variety this next time with a combination of an effective Phytophthora resistance gene (Rps gene) and a good background of ""field tolerance"" or ""partial resistance.""
Remember rust.
As soybeans approach flowering (R1), check with university extension sources, Web sites, dealers, farm magazines and other information sources regarding Asian soybean rust. You can track disease due to the many states that participate in the soybean rust sentinel plot program. One good source in particular to check is USDA's rust Web site, www.sbrusa.net.

If soybean rust is moving closer to you and your fields are between R1 and R5 (beginning seed) and your area has adequate moisture, consider applying a fungicide. Know the difference in symptoms between soybean rust and some of the common foliar diseases like bacterial blight, downy mildew, frogeye leaf spot, and Septoria brown spot.

It's important to know what you're trying to control. For example, applying a foliar fungicide application will not control bacterial blight. Not only are you out of money, but applying an unnecessary fungicide application does not follow the principles of integrated pest management (IPM). IPM is a multi-step pest-management strategy of which chemical control is only one part.

Scout for late-season diseases.
Be aware that some late-season disease symptoms may not appear until soybean plants are in the reproductive stages (beginning at R1). In some cases, the pathogen may have infected the soybean at an earlier time, but symptoms are not observed until later. Examples include:

Sudden death syndrome
Brown stem rot
White mold
Stem canker
Anthracnose
Regularly sample for soybean cyst nematode (SCN) in the fall.
This will let you know if populations are going up, down, or staying constant. This is important to know because not all varieties marketed as being SCN-resistant are equal, and some resistant varieties may not be as effective as they once were.

It's not always possible to control field crop diseases when you find them, says Carl Bradley, University of Illinois Extension plant pathologist.",0
630,KNOW YOUR CORN DISEASES,"As corn harvest nears in the Midwest, farmers say they're finding some issues in both crops that they worry might cause some yields to slip from the top end.

""During the last week many people have noted deterioration of upper leaves in the corn canopy,"" says Iowa State University (ISU) Extension agronomist in Muscatine, Iowa, Virgil Schmitt.

The corn's showing signs of Goss's wilt, say farmers like Agriculture.com Marketing Talk member dapper7, who says in his location in northwest Iowa, ""scattered fields of corn appear to be dying prematurely.""

But, it can be tough to distinguish between Goss's wilt and northern corn leaf blight, another common disease this time of year that shows similar symptoms. ""Depending on the field, there often is more than one reason, some of which look very similar,"" Schmitt says.

Iowa State University plant pathologist Alison Robertson points out a few differences between the 2 diseases here.

Then there's antracnose top die-back, another similar disease. It takes a close look to tell the difference between top die-back and Goss's wilt, Schmitt says.

""Both Goss's wilt and anthracnose leaf blight can have 'freckles.' Look at the freckles under 20X or more magnification; if they are 'porcupine-like,' it is anthracnose,"" he says. ""If the lesions have a shine, like varnish, that is dried exudate or ooze from Goss's wilt.""

The bad news is there's not a whole lot to do about any of these diseases. ""The bottom line, however, is that there is nothing that can be done to slow down or stop any of them at this point in time,"" Schmitt adds.

The good news is, depending on your location, harvest may not be far off. Agriculture.com Harvest is moving along briskly in the deep and mid-South, and with some farmers starting combines in Missouri and parts of Illinois, widespread harvest won't be far off in the Midwest.

""For corn located near Kansas City, St. Louis, and parts of southern Illinois, some farmers are reporting 20-21% moisture,"" reports Agriculture.com Markets Bureau Chief Mike McGinnis. ""That is low and nearing harvest-ready.""",0
674,NEW STUDY REVIEWS SEED PROTECTION BENEFITS,"Ever wondered just how beneficial seed protection is in your operation? CropLife Foundation (CLF) has announced that it will publish a comprehensive report in spring 2013 entitled �The Role of Precision Seed Protection in Modern Crop Production.� The report will closely examine research from case studies conducted throughout the U.S. and will outline the benefits of using pesticides for sustainable crop production, CLF says. The group presented their early findings at the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) Corn & Sorghum and Soybean Seed Research Conference and Seed Expo 2012.

�Precision seed protection, as part of an integrated pest management system and when combined responsibly with other crop protection products, makes it possible for U.S. farmers to grow more resilient crops that can withstand harsh climate conditions and provide consumers more healthy and nutritious food choices,� said Jay Vroom, chairman of the board of directors of CLF. �CLF looks forward to the publication of this report in the spring and sharing important findings on the benefits of precision seed protection for modern agriculture.�

The report cites many specific benefits for modern crop production as a result of precision seed protection, including:

Research demonstrates that the use of precision seed protection in corn results in improved plant health and stress tolerance under drought conditions;
Soybean seed treatments reduce the damage caused by soybean cyst nematodes, which can decrease yields by 15 to 30 percent;
Modern precision equipment is highly computerized and ensures that seed protection products are applied at the correct rates and leave minimal environmental impact;
Precision seed protection increases crop yields, decreases operating costs and encourages other sustainable practices such as no-till farming.
Global precision seed protection sales grew from $700 million in 1997 to $2.25 billion in 2010 and are projected to exceed $3 billion in 2016, according to the report.

The earliest forms of seed treatment appeared in ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman civilizations, the report says, when growers soaked seeds in onion and cypress sap. In the 17th century, farmers discovered a reduction in crop disease after soaking seeds in sea water and utilized that technique for 100 years. Copper sulfate was a treatment option throughout the 1800s. �Next generation� products were introduced in the 1970s and neonicotinoid insecticides were first registered as seed treatments by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1994. The introduction of these modern products revolutionized seed protection and led to greater populations of healthier, more uniform plants.",0
675,HOW TO PROTECT HIGH GRAIN PRICES,"While visiting with producers this winter at various trade shows and meetings, one thing continues to be apparent. Producers want to do better with their grain marketing, especially with fabulous prices currently available for grain markets. With just a few weeks to go until the start of planting kicks in for much of the Midwest, use this time to sit in your office and brush up on your grain marketing skills! 

The past decade of both volatile markets and lackluster markets have led to reminding us of the importance of taking advantage of cash marketing strategies when prices are opportunistic. Having a plan ready now will allow you to pull the trigger on cash sales at appropriate times in 2022 and even 2023. Also review the various futures and options strategies you can use to protect unpriced bushels should prices fall lower. In the day and age where one tweet can move a futures market limit up or limit down, you have to be on your game when it comes time to take advantage of marketing opportunities! Looking for a place to start this refreshment process? Look no further.

WAYS TO LOCK IN YOUR CASH SALES

While there is more than one way to lock in a cash sale, let�s keep it simple and focus on the two most popular methods. Let�s first look at forward contracting. This is a contract between you and a physical buyer of your grain: the elevator, ethanol plant, or processing plant. The forward contract specifies price, time, quantity, and date of delivery. Once you agree to this contract with the buyer, you know exactly where, when, the quantity, and the final price received of the grain you are responsible for delivering to the buyer. The potential negative is the inability to benefit from higher prices should prices increase after you have entered into the agreement. 

Another way to sell grain with a commitment to deliver and not a lock in basis (basis is the difference between the cash prices and the price in Chicago on the Board) is called hedge-to-arrive. Hedge-to-arrive contracts require a delivery period on a specified quantity of bushels. The futures price is locked in and known, yet this contract leaves the potential for basis improvement in the months ahead. If your elevator offers hedge-to-arrive contracts, make sure you understand the cost (hidden fees) as well as ramifications if delivery cannot be made. 

WAYS TO PROTECT PRICE �ON PAPER�

Sometimes, you may not be comfortable making cash sales, especially if the crop growing in your field appears to be in disarray. In lieu of cash grain contracts, you can sell futures or use options with a commodity brokerage firm. To do this, you need to open an account, and find a broker you trust to teach you the ins and outs of different marketing tools and how to properly use them.

When looking at protecting prices and giving yourself a price floor if you don�t have a big risk tolerance, then the tool you want to use is buying a put option. You pay a one-time premium and commission for the put (no margin calls). If you are wanting to establish a price floor and leave the topside open for cash price appreciation, then buying a put is a great tool to use. 

Another strategy is a fence. A fence is a strategy that �fences in� a range of prices. A short fence is where you buy a put and sell an out-of-the-money call. The objective is to reduce the cost of the put with premium collected from the sold call. The sold call is a marginable position, so you will need quick access to cash in order to meet potential margin calls if futures prices move higher. (But keep in mind, if the futures price is rallying, likely your cash price is moving higher as well, and you benefit as the cash price on your grain increases.)

Lastly, a bear put spread is the purchase of a put combined with selling an out-of-the-money put in the same contract month. While selling a put can help reduce the cost of the long put, it does cap your ability to gain on the position if the futures prices drop. As a producer, you should question whether you really want to cap your long put option value if prices are weak. Yet, if you believe the market can go down only to a specific level, then selling an out-of-the-money put option may be advisable.

If you have a bigger risk tolerance, then you might want to consider selling futures. The potential negative is that you will be required to meet margin calls, which can grow dramatically if the futures price rallies. Unlike a hedge-to-arrive contract where the grain elevators meet the margin requirement (behind the scenes on your behalf), the risk shifts to you, and you will need to have cash flow readily available to finance your account.

Whatever your strategy, make sure it works for you, that you understand it, and you�re comfortable with it. Preparation is key to marketing, and by preplanning and being prepared, you�ll be many steps ahead of most. As a producer, you must be aware of the tools you can use to shift risk. Don�t bury your head in the sand. Doing nothing is also a risk, and perhaps is the riskiest marketing decision of all.

676,"FARMERS TO GET NEEDED SEED, CROP PROTECTION, CO-OP MANAGER SAYS","INDIANOLA, Iowa -- While the livestock side of agriculture is fighting the spread of the coronavirus in its meatpacking plants, the agronomy side of the industry steams full speed ahead with planting this year�s crops.

Make no mistake, University of Illinois FarmdocDaily experts say, logistical impacts of the pandemic will be seen throughout agriculture. Discussions have already started about how the U.S. can produce needed agronomy products vs. sourcing them from other countries, namely China.

Like many commodities groups, agribusinesses, and universities, Farmdoc experts are holding a series of webinars focusing on the impacts of the coronavirus.

2020 PLANTING PRODUCTS
This week, the topic highlighted food supply logistics and crop supply logistics for this year�s planting season.

Jeff Bunting, GrowMark�s crop protection manager, says with this year�s seed supply in position, the focus shifts to crop-protection movement. 

The Illinois-based cooperative, ranked as the fourth-largest agricultural cooperative in the U.S., serves farmers through its FS System and 550 retail locations. To start the season, the company has used 35 different terminals to pull anhydrous ammonia. The long lines at these terminals reflect farmers� intentions to plant large amounts of corn acres, Bunting says.

Since the coronavirus, GrowMark has changed how it distributes products.

�Instead of having products staged at our main locations, we are trucking products to the distribution locations of our commercial customers. The truck drivers have done a phenomenal job at getting our products to agribusiness and grocery businesses that we work with,� Bunting says.

CROP NUTRIENTS, SEED, AND CROP PROTECTION 
With multiple source points, GrowMark sees few problems getting its customers what they need for this year�s planting season.

�As of Tuesday, 99% of the corn seed has been shipped from the company�s warehouse location to the retailers. And, the seed is in position to get to the farmer. For soybeans, 97% of the seed has been shipped and in position for the planting season,� Bunting says.

In addition, even though anhydrous demand is up, GrowMark has seen a last-minute run on soybean seed. 

CROP-PROTECTION SUPPLIES
Regarding crop protection, most of GrowMark�s actives that would be needed were stateside before the coronavirus outbreak, Bunting says.

�Getting those actives into production, packaged, and onto the market, I feel pretty good. My list of actives that I still need from China, right now, is pretty small. Also, we had a large carryover from 2019, because not as much corn or soybeans got planted. So, the crop-protection inventory stayed in the warehouse; we still have that inventory to pull from for 2020. I feel pretty good about our ability to supply the farmer-customers the herbicide, insecticide, and pesticides they need for this year,� Bunting says.

Also, since China�s factories are starting to get back online from the pandemic, some of the crop-protection actives needed will be available.

China produces 1.46 million tons of pesticides, 49% of the world�s usage.

2020 LOGISTICS
Looking ahead to this year�s planting season, the likelihood of a bottleneck with logistics is going to be the challenge the industry faces, Bunting says.

�We�ve done a great job of staging products and getting them to the retailers. The question now becomes can we get to farmers what they want when they want it,� Bunting says. �We�re staying in close contact with our customers to think about the multi-segments of the season. We�re asking them what they will need for the next 30, 60, and 90 days. I feel confident that we have enough product to get the crop off to a good start. We may have to pivot and go to Plan B or Plan C.�

Bunting notes that truck drivers are driving long hours, warehouse workers are trying to practice social distancing, and everyone is trying to minimize any overall impact from coronavirus.

As far as how the crop-protection industry looks postcoronavirus, there are more questions than answers at this point, Bunting says.  

�We could see a delay in innovation and product sourcing,� Bunting says. �In the past two to three years, we�ve seen more domestic production of crop-protection products, in an attempt to rely less on other countries.�

With the closings of numerous meatpacking plants, due to employee COVID-19 infections and deaths, the topic of the U.S. food supply chain is getting the attention of many.

LIVESTOCK AG
Scott Irwin, University of Illinois economist, says the main concern surrounds the meat, dairy, and egg supply chain.

�Because of the more concentrated nature of processing and slaughtering of livestock, the concern lies there,� Irwin says. �We�re clearly seeing a slowdown in slaughtering capacity. Some of the slowdown is due to a huge drop from restaurant demand and the shutting of numerous meatpacking plants.�

To be sure, the slaughter numbers for hogs were down 35%, cattle 16%, last week vs. the previous week.

As these issues back up the just-in-time livestock production system, there could be long tail effects from the coronavirus, Irwin says.

�Milk is being dumped, laying eggs are being broken and thrown away. So, this kind of backup has to be happening in the livestock slaughtering systems. If you are not slaughtering market-ready animals, they have to be backing up someplace,� Irwin says.

REGULATORY CHANGES
It�s too early to tell if U.S. agriculture will see any regulatory changes due to the coronavirus pandemic, Bunting says.

�We�re stressing the use of hand sanitizer, the proper handling of ammonia and other nitrogen sources. But short term, I don�t see any changes,� Bunting says.

Irwin sees changes coming at the strategic and political levels.

�I think there will be tremendous pressure to diversify supply chains for critical items, particularly medicine and food. There will be a lot of rethinking about our crop-protection and crop-production materials that are linked to China. I think there will be pressure to rethink our relationship with China, and agriculture has a very large stake there,� Irwin says.",0
796577,Organic Farming: How to Market Amla?,"Kailash Choudhary has been practicing organic farming since the year 2000. He got certified in 2003. He works in several agricultural areas including animal husbandry.

Choudhary first came to know about organic farming from a Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK). There, he learnt that organic farming was nothing new; in the ancient times, when there were no chemicals, farmers still practiced agriculture. The need of the day was to add new research findings to these age-old methods. Motivated by this knowledge, and with a desire to do something new, Choudhary took his first steps towards organic farming. He started incorporating these techniques slowly. “Farming is not like a switch you can press and begin with everything anew. You have to adapt new techniques slowly,” he said.

Organic farming: the Basics

The Nitrogen Factor

Choudhary explains that the crops which do not require huge quantities of nitrogen are the ones which can be most easily cultivated through organic farming. Crops like wheat, bajra, and maize, which greatly require nitrogen, should be produced on a smaller scale by farmers, he suggests, adding further that green manure should be used for them. In two or three years, the farmer would have a better understanding of what to grow, and how much.

Keeping Diseases Away

A farmer should have complete knowledge of the types of crop related diseases, the time when they occur, and prevention methods one must follow to avoid them, Choudhary says. He also advocates periodical spray of neem and cow-urine in the fields. “Prevention is always better than cure,” he says and urges all the farmers to be alert about their crops and make farming their first priority.

Farmer to Customer

Choudhary believes that farmers should market their crops directly to customers. This effectively eliminates the role of middle-men and makes them earn greater profits. It also helps in building trust between farmers and their customers.

Vedanta Organic Products: From a Bunch of Indian Gooseberries (Amla) to a Brand

Choudhary planted a bunch of Indian gooseberries, commonly known as amla, in 1998. He says that horticulture used to be the trend during those days. Lacking experience, he suffered setbacks in the beginning. In the fourth year, the plants bore fruit. Excited with the yield, his brother decided to pluck the still unripe fruits and sell them to the market. “It wasn’t sold even for a single rupee,” Choudhary says. This brought a gloomy atmosphere to his household. Dejected, he approached the KVK which had initially helped him cultivate them. They advised him to visit a nearby village and observe how gooseberries were produced and marketed there.

Choudhary saw that these cultivators had turned the fruits into various products like pickles, juices, and sweet preserves (murabba). Further into the village, he noted how the women were preparing these on mud stoves. He observed everything for a week and then set out for his own village with a reliable person who had knowledge of these processes. Back at home, he put into practice everything he had learnt and seen. Thus began his long and successful journey.

In 2004, he attempted growing and marketing the gooseberries again. He was again unable to sell the entire produce as the community he lived in was a very small one. Choudhary returned to the agriculture department and enquired with them about marketing the fruits. He was then directed by a senior officer to set up a stall at a government building and begin from selling there. This idea proved to be a great success and also earned him bigger opportunities, awards, and media attention.

After spending a significant time learning gooseberry recipes and exhibiting them, his problems related to marketing were solved. He then took step further and established his own brand, Vedanta Organic Products.

Conclusion

Choudhary is a progressive farmer who believes that there is no age-limit for learning. “I am very old and yet I have learn, so, anybody can do the same. It is all about determination and will power,” he told Krishi Jagran’s correspondent.

Choudhary can be contacted at +91 9829083117. Address - Kotputli District, Jaipur, Rajasthan- 303108.",0
796579,Learn All About Licensed Opium Poppy Cultivation From This Farmer,"Krishi Jagran spoke with Bhagwat Sharma, a farmer from Madhya Pradesh, about vegetable cultivation for its Farmer the Brand (FTB) section.

Bhagwat Sharma is a farmer based in Madhya Pradesh. He cultivates onion, soybean, and opium. Sharma explains that he chose soybean cultivation because it is a Kharif crop which many farmers from Marwa, Rajasthan prefer.

On the other hand, onion is a cash crop which fetches good market prices. Sharma plants soybean in the monsoon season and for onions he has a special nursery. The latter is planted in the fields as soon as it rains. If there’s no rain, he relies on irrigation methods.

Certified Seeds for Better Yields

Sharma suggests farmers that it is better to use certified seeds for soybean cultivation because the sprouting capacity of soybean is comparatively less. It is to be noted that production is directly dependent on sprouting capacity. Sharma prepares the seeds of onions himself; he says the reddest of the onions have these seeds. He then prepares the saplings which are then planted in the fields.

Opium Cultivation: Legalities & Field Practices

More interestingly, Sharma discloses how opium cultivation is done. Opium cultivation is prohibited in India under Section 8 of NDPS Act, 1985. It can be only practiced by farmers after getting a license from Central Bureau of Narcotics under Rule 8 of NDPS Rules, 1985 in the states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. The farmers who obtain this license sow the crop in the last week of October and the first week of November.

The field is prepared and seed beds are made. It is then supplied with DAP and fertilizers. Opium seeds are very small and one has to be very careful with the amount of water applied. In fact, Sharma says, cultivating opium requires so much of care that it is akin to raising a child.

Sharma further talks about the difficulties faced by a farmer because of climate change. He says that it is impossible to cultivate anything without the use of pesticides and a farmer has to make at least one round of his field everyday to check if there has been a mistake. If a field is left without inspection even for two days, the crops are certain to be diseased. Moreover, the fields are to be sprayed every 8-10 days with pesticides and fungicides. Sharma mostly uses the bed method of irrigation but he also says that the drip method has been gaining popularity nowadays.

A lot of farmers benefit from the subsidies provided by the government and Sharma is one of them. But this has not solved all his problems. Most of the problems in agriculture arise because of unfavourable weather conditions. Crop diseases are no small menace as well. The event of the pandemic and the government imposed lockdown has further exacerbated these issues as farmers have not been able to sell their products on time and have not been able to fetch right prices for them.

Sharma’s message to all people is to embrace agriculture and prefer it over jobs for self-dependency. He says that farmers are the backbone of the Indian economy and must be revered and encouraged.",0
796755,How to replace chemical fertilisers with organic & bio-fertilisers,"Organic and bio-fertilisers should also be made suitable for application through micro-irrigation methods

Recently, India emerged as a torch bearer at the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as it presented very ambitious yet promising goals for the coming decade.

But is it possible to achieve these goals without considering the climate adaptability and sustainability of agriculture?

Sustainability and climate adaptability of our agriculture (our crops and soil) depend on what we put into our fields, what leaches from our fields and gets added to our water / air. Clearly, the needle is pointing at our nutrient management practices.

Since the Green Revolution, our dependence on chemical fertilisers as a source of plant nutrients has increased manifold and this made India a self-sufficient nation. Why still did we rank 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index?

One of the major reasons is that somewhere, we lost sight of our traditional agricultural practices and use of chemical fertilisers became imbalanced or skewed.

Imbalanced chemical fertilisation then started showing its ill effects in terms of soil health deterioration, vis-a-vis organic matter depletion, soil structure degradation, disturbance in soil hydro-thermal balance, heavy metal contamination and above all, an imbalanced human diet, to name a few.

Yes, we need to feed our ever-increasing mouths, but this must be done without further deteriorating our soils, climate or for that matter, human health. The path forward can start with balanced Integrated Nutrient Management and slowly pave a way towards adapting organic or biofertilisers as an alternative to chemical fertilisers.

One must note that this year, farmers are hassled because there is no urea or diammonium phosphate in the market. But the Green Revolution started with guano (seabird and bat droppings). Then why can’t it be done today, even if at small scale or in an integrated manner?

Moreover, looking at the changing perspectives of consumers and improving health consciousness among masses, farmers cannot avoid this adaptation for long.

Read more: High fertiliser prices shock farmers even as ministry denies shortage reports

Adaptation of organic or biofertilisers by our nearly 43 per cent of workforce has its own share of challenges and without doubt, it would be a slow process. This would require an extremely strong approach and, by extension, workforce.

Lab-to-land programmes of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and state agriculture universities must come out of the shackles of multi-coloured files and be implemented on the field, to convince farmers of the results.

A farmer will not and should not accept anything that does not give them fruitful results. Using practical demonstrations and statistical analysis, it must be demonstrated to the farmers that yield will not reduce, their benefit-cost ratio will improve and quality parameters of the market for the produce will be met.

It must be displayed how, through this adaptation, their future generations will thank them for the soil, water and air they will inherit. Now, if we succeed at convincing the farmers, we need to meet their demands of certified quality, assured nutrient content, organic and bio fertilizers which are competitive enough with chemical fertilizers in terms of nutrient content, solubility, plant availability and prices.

Organic and bio-fertilisers must penetrate the fertiliser market the way urea or single super phosphate did in the 60s. A proper retail, marketing and distribution network needs to be penned out.

Read more: CSE report flags poor state of organic fertilisers, biofertilisers sector in India

Organic and bio-fertilisers should also be made suitable for application through micro-irrigation methods. Also, once farmers use these adaptations, they must be ensured that their produce — perishable or non-perishable — will have storage, transportation and market facilities available, along with accurate certification services.

In the end, for their organic produce, farmers should get a price which is at least at par or more than the prices gained by the counterpart.

As and when we start overcoming these challenges, we might see adaptation of organics and biofertilisers at a large scale. Till then, farmers should get the best of both worlds.

796769,"CSE report flags poor state of organic fertilisers, biofertilisers sector in India","There is a widespread availability of inferior quality as well as spurious biofertiliser and organic fertiliser products across the country

Availability, quality and uptake of biofertilisers and organic fertilisers in India is poor, flagged a new report.

These non-chemical options are considered critical to the transition from chemical-based to sustainable farming practices like organic and natural farming. Availability of cost-effective quality biofertilisers and organic fertilisers is, therefore, of utmost importance. However, these sectors have been neglected over the years.

Both the sectors have so far received limited attention and support by the central and most state governments, compared to the chemical fertiliser sector. The government subsidy received by the chemical fertiliser sector was to the tune of Rs 1.3 lakh crore in 2020-21, while the budget allocated to the entire organic fertiliser and biofertilisers sector was limited to a few hundred crores, the CSE report found.

The State of Biofertilizers and Organic Fertilizers in India was released by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based think-tank at its recently concluded National Conclave on Sustainable Food Systems from April 19-21, 2022.

India has become the second-highest producer and consumer of chemical fertilisers in the world. Per hectare chemical fertiliser consumption has been increasing over the years, including in the last two decades.

The country’s soil health is also poor: The soil sample test results showed severe and widespread deficiency of organic carbon, macronutrients and micronutrients in Indian soils, according to the report.

The Union government has several schemes and programmes to promote biofertilisers and organic fertilisers. Some of these schemes are aimed at supporting farmers, while others support manufacturers.

But only a very small part of these schemes contribute to the sector. The potential of these schemes is not being fully utilised. Very small funds have been spent since the beginning of these schemes. States have also not shown much interest.

There is a lack of data on companies, their registered products, authorisations given and production details of various types of manufacturers related to biofertilisers and organic fertilisers sector. State governments may have kept the records, but compiled countrywide information is lacking.

The available information is not enough to develop a sense of the overall structure and composition of the industry and sector in the country. Available production data of states and country showed significant variations between years, with no explanation offered.

Only a handful of the states were responsible for most of the country’s production. For example, more than 90 per cent of the country-wide production of carrier-based solid biofertilisers is limited to only five states. Same is the case with liquid biofertilisers.

In the case of organic fertilisers, huge irregularities or discrepancies are observed in available data. India produced 3.88 million tonnes of organic fertilisers in 2020-21, which is a dramatic decrease from the 338.72 million tonnes in 2017-18, according to government data.

Similarly, data for years 2018–19 showed Karnataka as the biggest producer of organic fertilisers, and this single state contributed 94 per cent share in countrywide production.

The utilisation of production capacity remained low for the sector. This is linked to limited demand, which in turn is related to poor quality of products as well as limited government support for promotion of non-chemical fertilisers. A level-playing field is missing for manufactures of biofertilisers and organic fertilisers, as well as for farmers willing to use non-chemical fertiliser options.

There is a widespread availability of inferior quality as well as spurious biofertiliser and organic fertiliser products across the country.

Media in various states have regularly reported on the poor quality of biofertiliser and organic fertiliser products and issues related to poor fertiliser control order (FCO) implementation by state agriculture departments, variation in laboratory test results between state and centre-owned laboratories, existence of fake companies, and several complaints by farmers.

Often, biofertilisers and organic fertilisers procured by the state through tenders under several schemes are of very inferior quality. Stakeholders indicate widespread corruption and faulty tender process in such procurements. Farmers do not get good results because of such poor quality products and lose confidence in organic and bio-inputs available in the market.

Quality control infrastructure is poor. Many states do not have their own testing laboratories. Testing capacities of existing laboratories in the country are not utilised properly. For example, only 28 per cent of the capacity of seven Regional Centre of Organic Farming laboratories was utilised in 2019-20.

The number of biofertiliser samples tested decreased to 483 in 2019–20 from 654 in 2013–14. The proportion of biofertiliser samples failing the quality tests increased from 1 per cent in 2013–14 to 44 per cent in 2019–20. In the case of organic fertilisers, only 477 samples were tested in 2019–20.

The percentage of samples failing the tests rose to 46 in 2019–20 from nine in 2013–14. The other concern is that these laboratories have even tested those samples, which are not approved by the Fertiliser (Inorganic, Organic or Mixed) (Control) Order.

Other than quality control, barriers which are hampering growth of these sectors are mostly related to funding, subsidies and support for promotion of biofertilisers and organic fertilisers as well as data collection and reporting.

The good part, however, is that some initiatives are being taken in certain states and at the individual level. But it is not enough and a lot needs to be done if organic and natural farming is to become a mass movement in this country.

The need of the hour is to have a targeted, ambitious and well-funded nationwide programme to drive the change towards organic and natural farming. The quality of biofertilisers and organic fertilisers must be ensured by developing and institutionalising a robust monitoring and enforcement mechanism through collaboration between the Centre and states.

Production and availability of these inputs must be ensured and their use must be promoted through a multi-pronged approach by the Centre and states. Massive potential of these sectors, which exists in this country, need to be properly utilised and up-scaled.

This is the first article in a series on India’s non-chemical fertiliser sector.

796785,"India’s natural, organic farming strategy for rice and wheat","This can help in targeting global export market, thereby feeding the world population and getting valuable foreign exchange for the country

India is predominantly agrarian — 80 per cent of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. Rice and wheat are the staple for 90 per cent of the country’s people.

Till the early 1960’s, the predominant mode of cultivation was what is now called “organic farming”, with no synthetic fertilisers or pesticides available or known.

At that time, farmers relied on cow dung, twigs of leguminous plants like Crotalaria juncea, Tephrosia, neem and jeelugu. These materials mulched the fields ploughed for rice plantation. Oil cakes of groundnut, castor, neem were also used which is a good source of nitrogen.

Since the use of urea from the beginning of the 1960s, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based fertilisers became available after the establishment of industrial plants at Sindri (Bihar) Udyog Mandal (Kerala).

Fortunately, in this decade, synthetic pesticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), endrin, and others entered the market. Another spectacular discovery was that of the high-yielding hybrid wheat and rice. The high-yielding wheat was discovered by Norman Borlaug (Nobel Prize winner) and was rapidly adopted by India largely due to the pioneering work of Dr Swaminathan and MV Rao.

Swaminathan is remembered as the ‘father of Green Revolution’ and Rao as the “wheat man of India”. With hybrid varieties and synthetic fertilisers and insecticides, the production of rice per acre increased to 40 quintals from 10 quintals, a tremendous victory in fighting hunger.

There were also some setbacks during the 1960s and 70s. India’s budget (read agriculture) is dependent on the monsoon season, as George Curzon pointed out in 1905.

Due to drought from 1964-70, India had to import food and became heavily dependent on the United States for wheat supplies under the Public Law 480 agreement. At one time, we were eagerly waiting for the arrival of a ship full of wheat at the Mumbai port. The late former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave a call to “miss a meal” on Monday nights as a part of the Jai Kisan movement.

Green Revolution

Ultimately, the Green Revolution was initiated. The theme of the initiative was to boost food grains production of rice and wheat using any method and at any cost.

Success followed many setbacks. Biologist-turned-science-writer Rachel Carson published a seminal book called Silent Spring, focused on the harmful effects of pesticides, primarily DDT on our health and environment.

DDT was found to be non-biodegradable and its remnants were traced everywhere — in our body, soil and water. Studies showed its effects on liver and kidneys, including causing cancers.

Scientists rapidly found alternatives and advocated Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM is a need-based use of pesticides, alternating crops, intercropping as well as usage of bird perches where birds rest, detect insects on crops and eat them.

After DDT, other insecticides like monocrotophos, metasystox, cypermethrin came into use but these are equally harmful to humans, livestock and fish.

The “turn to nature” to get pesticide-free food has become a priority. The order of the day is organic farming — natural farming or zero-budget agriculture — which is welcome and most wanted in the agriculture sphere.

Not without setbacks

The first and foremost sound solution is the usage of organic manures from compost, cow dung and ploughing and mulching of leguminous plants. Several plant-based botanical pesticides were discovered. Neem oil, neem kernel extracts, which contain azadirachtin, is the active principle discovered by Germans, the United Kingdom and US.

Neem revived the hope of using harmless pesticides but its availability is very low. Several commercial formulations were available in India. Karanj oil (Karanjin active principle), several leaf extracts like Adathoda and garlic-buds aqueous extracts are found to be effective to some extent as active repellants but they cannot replace synthetic pesticide.

There is a growing awareness in India to cultivate the crops by natural fertilisers such as cow dung, leguminous green manures, compost, vermicomposting and biopesticides fungi, bacteria and virus-based pesticides like Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseuedomonas aegle, Trichoderma verdi.

These bio-pesticides are chiefly produced from diseased insects and soil, among other things. However, it only has limited use on too few fruit and vegetable crops. The problem with the bio-pesticide production is that it is confined to a small industry with no standardisation and doubtful efficacy.

Several symposia are held by non-governmental organisations, ideal farmers and governments. Many agricultural magazines hail the miracles of higher yields from organic farming. Particular mention should be made about jeevamrutham — a recently designed concoction called Ramabanam, which gained prominence. These concoctions are made from jaggery, ginger, cow milk, cow curd, cow dung, cow urine, asafoetida. All the ingredients are mixed and fermented for a week, diluted and sprayed on crops.

It is claimed that the product can be used as a fertiliser and a pesticide. The farmers who experimented were quick to endorse the products. Their studies on organic farming presented in symposia on organic farming, however, were confined to few vegetables like tomatoes over a limited area. The yield, the farmers said, is high but not quantified with randomised block design studies.

The active principle of such concoctions is unknown and doesn’t stand scientific security. Moreover, the cost of these concoctions is as high as pesticides and starting products like cow dung are not available in plenty as of today.

For about 90 per cent Indians, rice or wheat are almost exclusively the staple food. So, encouragement of organic farming in a country like India will be meaningful, if applied for rice / wheat. Studies on these crops should also be prioritised.

The inconvenient truth, as many farmers put it, is that the land is infertile now without urea in the first few days of rice plantation, and with no application of synthetic pesticides, the entire crop is prone to pests resulting in no yield.

The challenge for agriculture scientists is how to maintain the current volume of yield (40 quintals per acre) with organic farming. We need to take with caution some sporadic success stories of organic farming on vegetables and fruits grown in an acre or two.

Thus, all the available tools we have with us, like bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, green manure and vermicompost, their limitation is discussed herein. Constraints of sustainable organic farming are:

None of the organic farming tools are available, especially for organic farming of rice that is the staple food in India. Importantly, the whole organic farming depends on cow dung, which is dwindling even as we are particular about their protection (gosamrakshana).

The staple food for cattle is rice straw. While we claim rice production is high and in surplus, the cost of rice remains very high and is not affordable for the poor man. Thus, the increase of cattle population is linked to paddy by rice production. Both are interlinked.

Quantification for pesticide residues in food should be done by High Performance Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectra / Mass Spectra (HPLC / MS / MS) method. The sophisticated method has been adopted by advanced countries but is still not in use in India.

The real structure of crop production is dependent on high-yielding hybrid seeds. Continuous research on high yielding varieties by cross breeding with pest resistant wild varieties is essential.

Compost from urban areas and vermicompost, in particular, don’t seem to have been examined for pesticide residues and harmful trace elements such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead is needed by using HPLC /MS / MS method and atomic absorption spectroscopy.

Introduction of transgenic varieties is not recommended for organic and natural farming. Therefore, it is wise to use the first three sprays on crops with natural organic materials and the last two sprays with synthetic pesticides.

Research on organic farming should be done using robust scientific methods only. Surprisingly, rice was found to contain high pesticides and trace elements.

This technique should be standardised in India. Our slogan should be “natural and organic farming with high yields at an affordable price to the common man”. India’s wheat exports surpassed $872 million (2021-22) and rice exports in 2021-22 is likely to surpass the record $10 million, according to the agriculture department of the Government of India.

796859,Biotechnology assures leap in production,"Tissue culture can change the face of agriculture, asserts Ajit Thomas, who heads a firm that has gone in a big way for biotechnology in the cultivation of plants and flowers.

AJIT THOMAS, 37, is chairman of A V Thomas & Co, one of south India's leading business houses owning plantations in Palghat and Idukki producing tea, spices and rubber. The company has now expanded into biotechnology and this year, it hopes to reap bumper harvests. Down To Earth interviewed him in Madras recently.



Starting with cardamom in 1986, your company is considered a pioneer in using biotechnology for producing cardamom, bananas, flowers and, now, orchid plants commercially. What made you adopt this techniques?

It began with cardamom. Internationally, Indian cardamom was becoming uncompetitive. The Gautemalan yields were much higher than Indian yields and the domestic market was very strong at that time. So we had to think of some way to increase our yields. The only way to do this was to multiply the yields through tissue culture. Simultaneously, we launched our banana project. Our orchid project is the most recent.



Tissue culture is not the answer to all of the farmer's needs. It is only one more tool that can be used as part of an integrated package of practices to increase productivity. The extra cost for this method is justified by the phenomenal increase in productivity. The increase is exponential.



Was the tissue culture technology you used imported, developed indigenously, or was it modified of imported technology?

There has been minimal import content. The technology that people offer is okay for lab-scale operations. But when we scale it up for commercial production, we run into problems. We have developed the commercial technology in our own laboratory. For cardamom, the initial laboratory technology was developed by the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune. But commercial production using this technology would have made the product very expensive. So we had to modify it. After all, the key to success in business is to produce the right product at the right cost. We were the first to start commercial production using biotechnology and the first commercial lab was ours.



But there must be many more today?

As far as I know, there are about 10 companies in the business. Some, like Indo-American Hybrid Seeds, have made heavy investments. I don't know how they will make themselves viable. Small companies would require a certain amount of capital before they can enter this field. Many of the new entrants put in heavy investments -- anything from Rs 10 crore to Rs 12 crore. Our initial investment was about Rs 2.5 crore and we invested Rs 1 crore in research and development.



What are your feelings about the issue of patents and royalties?

We have already faced a problem with exports. In India there is no system of patents and the result is that importing countries are wary of our quality. Now, we are gaining the confidence of Holland. We get the tissue for flowers from Holland, we multiply them and re-export the product back to that country. In doing this, we have to observe some amount of security because the product should not go out of the lab into other hands. Some stray incidents have happened in the past.



On the question of royalty we do not face a problem. The Dutch growers ask for only a very reasonable amount as they know the cost of collecting the products is very high. For example, in Brazil, 60 per cent of the royalty goes to the agent who collects the products and only 40 per cent goes to the Dutch grower. We do our business mostly with Dutch companies. With the USA, we deal mostly with common foliage plants that have no patent or proprietory rights. On an average, we export close to four million plants a year to both the Netherlands and USA, with a turnover of about Rs 3 crore. You seem to have achieved considerable success with Indian orchids?

Orchids have a lot of potential even in the domestic market. We started our orchid project in early this year and so far we have sold orchid seedlings worth about Rs 35 lakh to 500 women in the country. A good orchid plant can last upto two weeks in non-airconditioned rooms without wilting, but there is the problem of transportation when it comes to exporting the plants. For the products to be acceptable, they have to reach their destination within 48 hours.



What will be your thrust area in the future?

It will continue to be the export of our main products like lily bulbs, foliage and other plants. Domestically the thrust will be on cardamom, banana and orchid production.



We feel that it is vital that we bring down the costs of producing these plants. And that has been the thrust of our research efforts. Our main lab atthe Cochin Export Processing Zone has the capacity for producing 4 million plants annually. We had stagnated at 2 million for quite some time and even thought that we wouldn't be able to cross this figure. Now we produce 6 million and feel that we have the potential for producing upto 10 million to 12 million. And all this is without expanding the lab. We can do it by developing better processes. When you increase your production you can naturally bring costs down. Biotechnology has also revolutionised yields per plant, too. The yield that the company gets from conventional seedlings is about 200 kg per ha. What we expect to harvest from our biotechnologically raised plantations in Idukki and Palghat is to the tune of 400 to 500 kg per ha.



Some of the tissue cultured cardamom plants yield upto 1,100 kg per ha. Compare this to the national average of 60 kg per hectare. Of course, there are people who get yields up to 200 kg from conventional stock, using irrigation and other additional inputs. But with biotechnology there is a quantum leap in production, with help from genetics. Of course, there is an increase in seedling cost, but this increase is arithmethic, while the benefit is exponential.



But what about the disease-resistance and longevity of these plants?

Tissue cultured plants have a shorter yield cycle. There is a definite need to increase their disease resistance. It is difficult to say that the tissue cultured plants will not get diseases in their lifetime. Nobody can say that. If diseases can be kept away for three or four years, we should be happy that we have achieved at least this.



What is the scope of biotechnology?

We, as a company, still have to explore related areas like variations and mutations. So far, we have restricted ourselves to tissue culture. I don't believe in across-the-board application of biotechnology for all activities. I would hate to see tissue culture being used to raise monocultures, like the government does, because I believe that tissue culture is more of a tool for preserving rare varieties and to get better plants. In our plantations, we always mix our clones.



What are the new ventures you have in mind?

We are moving towards integrating our knowledge in tissue culture to raise better quality spices from which oils and oleoresins will be extracted.",0
796939,Scientists identify genes that can increase drought resistance in plants,"African ‘orphan’ crop varieties to help plants battle high temperatures

Orphan crops like finger millets have adapted themselves to grow in harsh weather conditions. Photo Wikimedia Commons

Scientists might have a solution to growing concerns of climate change hampering crop productivity. Researchers have identified genes in Africa’s local food crops that can improve resistance to drought. Incorporating these genes through hybridisation might improve crop yield that is affected by increasing global temperatures and heatwaves.

Countries like India and Pakistan are also likely to be affected by the prolonged heatwaves, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimated. The UN body is responsible for coordinating responses to environmental issues.

In May 2022, the central government of India revised the wheat production by 5.7 per cent to 105 million tonnes in the 2021-22 crop year. The previous projection was 111.32 million tonnes, but the crop productivity has been affected due to the early onset of summer, the department of agriculture and farmers welfare had said.

“Africa is estimated to help meet 25 per cent of the world population’s food needs by 2050,” said Sunil Kumar Sahu, Shenzhen-based research scientist at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), working on genome research. Sahu is also the internal project manager of the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC), which works to address food security in the continent.

“Around two-thirds of global calories are derived from three crops mainly, rice, wheat and maise,” Sahu said, adding that Africa’s orphan crops remain less utilised.

Orphan crops are nutritious local food crops that could play a crucial role in combating hunger. These crops are not traded internationally but have adapted themselves to grow in harsh weather conditions.

Africa’s arid environment is not suited for crops like rice and maise. Orphan crops like finger millets, little millet, African yam bean, jojoba and jatropha are commonly found in the continent.

AOCC aims to sequence 101 such orphan crop species often neglected and under-utilised, said Sahu. “We have selected ten crops such as eggplant, breadfruit, jackfruit and moringa based on their nutritional value, productive capacity and adaptive abilities,” he added.

The consortium had identified genes that were high temperature tolerant, had increased salinity adaptability and had low water requirements that provided essential nutrition.

“For instance, jackfruit has a high starch value. Our jackfruit sequencing results identified a large expansion of genes related to sugar metabolism and starch, explaining their sticky characteristics,” said Sahu.

The fruit also stores a massive amount of energy and nutrition, including a range of vitamins and proteins. “Research shows that jackfruit also suits pre-diabetics and diabetics patients,” he said.

BGI, in collaboration with Huazhong Agricultural University, has developed a hybrid eggplant-tomato variety which allows a single plant to deliver both varieties. “Such methods can help improve agricultural productivity,” he said.

An enhanced version of perennial rice through crossbreeding techniques has also been developed. “The perennial rice allows you to harvest seeds multiple times as it grows back after harvesting. The variety can be harvested for up to five years, enabling more production with fewer labour costs,” Sahu further said.

These varieties have already been tried out successfully in African countries like Uganda.

Heatwaves and an overall increase in temperatures directly affect productivity by hampering pollination and a plant’s fertility, said Altafhusain Nadaf, a professor at the botany department of Savitribai Phule University in Pune. Nadaf is also working on developing resilient crop varieties.

Introducing tolerant genes to crops can increase their capacity to bear high temperatures, said Nadaf. “Adding these genes can increase the tolerance levels of plants to survive and deliver expected productivity,” he added.",0

798600,"Organic takeover: How 10,000 farmers of Telangana, Andhra are steering a silent movement","A federation of farmer-producer organisations has tapped into the growing organic market to help members raise incomes

Catering directly to the consumers’ needs assures better marketability and incomes. This is what nearly 10,000 farmers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have realised over the past decade and are now steering a silent organic movement.

It all began in 2009, when a group of consumers in Hyderabad, then part of unified Andhra Pradesh, established a cooperative society to source chemical-free produce directly from farmers.

Operating under the guidance of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), a Hyderabad-based research non-profit, the cooperative society over a period of time roped in a few farmers and began to sell the produce through a farmer-run retail store in Secunderabad and mobile retail vans that travelled to urban areas.

Soon, more and more organic farmers joined the cooperative society and what had started off as a consumers’ initiative became a farmers’ group. In 2013, when the government floated the concept of farmer producer organisation (FPO) to aggregate collection of produce and create market links for better prices under the Companies Act of 2013, CSA and the cooperative society saw this as an opportunity.

Establishing an FPO also helps gain financial support from the government. Thus, in 2014, all the farmers’ groups under the cooperative society registered themselves as organic FPOs, and the society at the helm as Sahaja Aharam Producer Company Limited, a unique “federation” of organic FPOs.

That was the year when Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh. But Sahaja Aharam continued its operation as a federation with FPOs from both the states. Today, as many as 23 organic FPOS with over 9,000 farmers across 180 villages are part the federation.

The groups are spread over the southern plateau and hills of Andhra Pradesh, as well as the north, central and southern parts of Telangana. The farmers grow paddy, cereals, oilseeds, pulses, fruits, vegetables and spices.

To obtain membership, FPOs buy equity in the federation. A board of five directors coordinates operations at the federation level along with the heads of the FPOs and support from CSA.

Market is key

Since inception, Sahaja Aharam has realised that there is a growing market for organic produce that can help farmers earn more. So it provides marketing and retail support for certified organic produce. Some of its member-FPOs, though, market both conventional and organic produce.

The federation also encourages and helps farmers to obtain organic certification and trains them on cultivation of specific crops; weed, pest and disease management; and preparation of organic and biological inputs. Some farmers are also trained in poultry and livestock farming.

Venkat Reddy from Kallem village in Jangaon district, Telangana, who has converted 1.2 hectares (ha) of his 6.07 ha farm to organic, said, “There was an initial loss in paddy yield after the shift, but the cost has reduced from Rs 25,000 per 0.4 ha to Rs 15,000. Currently, I grow organic paddy for my own consumption. But after seeing other farmers get 10-15 per cent more income from this variety, I plan to bring in more area under it.”

Regenerative or chemical-free cultivation has helped improve the local environmental conditions as well. Enabavi village in Telangana’s Hanamkoda district, which declared itself as the first organic village in the region in 2006 is now entirely free of pesticides, fertilisers and genetically modified crops.

All 52 farmer families of the village have shifted 110 ha to regenerative agriculture by composting organic waste, using cow dung manure and pest-trapping crops and harvesting water. “This has led to a rise in soil fertility,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of CSA.

With more farmers trying to benefit from regenerative agriculture, the federation is focused on helping its members gain a better market share. For this, it plans production strategies with its FPOs. It apprises them of trends in organic produce, sales figures and rates from the previous years.

“Unlike traditional FPOs, a lot of effort and business insight goes into production planning,” said Prasanna T P, chief executive of Sahaja Aharam. Further, to ensure quality, the federation tests 1 per cent of total produce for chemical pesticide residue.

“Sahaja Aharam buys my produce at 10-15 per cent higher price than the market,” said Vekanna Reddy, a farmer from Mulang village, Siddipet district, Telangana. The federation buys cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables and oilseeds at 10 per cent higher prices, which can increase based on quality. For paddy, rates can go higher.

The federation sells raw and processed products, which include food items, cosmetics and other non-food products. Some 45 per cent of the product range consists of organic fruits and vegetables. To set market prices, Sahaja Aharam follows two criteria.

First, the farmers’ share in the price must either be 50 per cent over the cost of cultivation, 12-15 per cent above the local market or 50 per cent of the average price in the previous year, whichever is highest.

For instance, it procures paddy crop from farmers at Rs 42 per kg and sells it for Rs 80 — cultivators earn more than half the retail price. Farmers are paid in two tranches, once during procurement and then after sale of products.

Second, to remain competitive, prices fixed by the federation are merely 15-20 per cent higher than those for conventional produce, but lower in comparison to those of some other organic players, particularly for pulses, groundnut oil and spices. Some 15 per cent of the price funds the federation’s operations.

For sales, the federation has expanded the retail stores. It now has two stores in Secunderabad and one each in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. Stores in Hyderabad and Secunderabad sell online as well. Their vans still operate in Hyderabad.

Sahaja Aharam also sells unlabelled produce in bulk to 110 aggregators. Currently, 55 per cent of sales are to bulk aggregators, 43 per cent through retail stores and 2 per cent online. Turnover has increased multifold over the last few years, from Rs 90.3 lakh 2018-19 to some Rs 2.61 crore in 2021-22.

Game-changer

The federation’s efforts to increase farm incomes go beyond market access.

“It has helped me re-learn sustainable farming techniques to increase yield. Earlier I used to earn Rs 29,600 per kg from paddy, now I earn Rs 33,000,” Krishan, a farmer from Jeedikal village in Jangaon district, who practices organic farming in his entire 2.8 ha, said. “I can save 50 per cent of cultivation costs, around Rs 10,000, by using organic inputs that I make,” he added.

The federation encourages farmers to grow traditional and new crops, based on water requirement, pest resistance, yield and market preferences. It also enables knowledge exchange and peer learning.

Further, it has introduced a mobile application called Pestoscope and set up surveillance centres in villages, and shares weather predictions from the India Meteorological Department and states. Sahaja Aharam also introduced an enterprise resource planning tool in 2018, developed by CSA, to manage production, finances, warehousing, sales and data analysis.

To diversify incomes and provide more livelihood opportunities, the federation has set up “food hubs” at six districts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for storage and processing. It is also diversifying its product range to include ready-to-eat and non-food products.

The federation provides several lessons on hand-holding support, storage, processing and marketing, however, like other FPOs in the country, it faces challenges such as poor financial support and lack of skilled humanpower. Addressing these hurdles will help it grow better.

798778,"Punjab to use ancient broadcasting technique to grow rice this Kharif, save groundwater","DSR can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35% over the traditional process of transplanting rice seedlings from a nursery to waterlogged fields

The Punjab government has decided to bring an area of 1.2 million hectare (mha) of under the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) method in the upcoming Kharif sowing season to conserve water while sowing paddy.

This is double the area that was sown under DSR in 2021 (0.6 mha). DSR is also called the ‘broadcasting seed technique’, under which seeds are directly drilled in the fields.

The field is laser levelled and a pre-sowing (rauni) irrigation is done. The field is prepared to optimum soil moisture condition and paddy (non-basmati) is seeded immediately. This technique saves groundwater and thus electricity, as opposed to the traditional water-intensive method.

It can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35 per cent over the traditional process of transplanting rice seedlings from a nursery to waterlogged fields.

The target was set after Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and state agriculture officers met with different farmer unions and groups April 17, 2022.

“We are organising training camps and making short videos to spread awareness and motivate them to adopt DSR. We are also taking views of farmers who adopted DSR last year on what kind of challenges they faced so as to work on them this time,” Gurvinder Singh, director of agriculture, Punjab, said.

The government had set a target of a million hectares last year but could bring only 0.6 mha under DSR. However, this was the state’s highest so far and 0.1 mha more than the 2020 figure.

DSR has been slowly gaining popularity. It picked up more during 2020 when Punjab and Haryana faced a labour crunch caused by migration of workers during the COVID-19 lockdown and farmers shifted to DSR, which is not labour-intensive.

MS Bhullar, principal agronomist, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) said some farmers have also pointed out that there should be regular supply of short duration variety seeds during the DSR period, like during the transplanting period and the government has agreed to that.

The government has set the period for DSR sowing between May 25 and June 5. Conventional transplanting sowing begins after June 15-20.

Rice is the major kharif crop of India and is grown in all the major agrarian states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Since groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these states, rice cultivation by transplanting has depleted the water table.

In Punjab, for instance, the groundwater declined in about 85 per cent of the state between 1984 and 2016, according to Central Ground Water Board data.

In such a scenario, DSR can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35 per cent, according to the 2011 study published in the journal Advances in Agronomy.

“There are only two ways to save groundwater. Either diversify from paddy to other crops or adopt water-saving techniques to grow paddy,” Bhullar said.

PAU’s recommendation for DSR in 2010 was only for medium to heavy textured soils, but demonstrations in 2020 showed the refined DSR technology can work even in sandy loam soils.

This has increased the area suitable for DSR in Punjab to 85 per cent from 45 per cent, Bhullar said.",0
798832,How 4 school girls are trying to get Andhra farmers to practise natural farming,"Zero Budget Natural Farming in Andhra Pradesh has helped farmers reduce input costs, thereby reducing debt

The message from four teenage girls from Hyderabad and Chennai is clear: There is a need to shift to natural farming.

Nandini Raju (16), Srilakshmi Reddy (16), Amrutha Potluri (16) and Sharada Gopalakrishnan (14) have been trying to get farmers to switch to Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) for the last four months.

The farming method is based on the elimination of chemical inputs and use of locally available resources to reduce farmers’ input costs and make agriculture remunerative.

The girls, all of whom are studying, have made several videos on popular channel YouTube to educate farmers on the benefits of sustainable farming practices. The videos can be found on social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook too.

The girls have so far spoken to 40-50 farmers in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur. Nilgari Foundation, a non-profit, helped them get in touch with farmers.

“We saw the news of a farmer from Telangana who lost his father to cancer some time ago. He wanted to convert to a healthier lifestyle. He now practises natural methods of farming and promotes it across the state. This only ascertained our belief in what we were doing,” said Raju.

The project, called Project Mritsa, is a part of the Purpose Academy, a program by 1M1B in partnership with the College of Engineering, Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at University of California, Berkeley and the Innovation Acceleration Group. 1M1B is a social innovation and future skills initiative aligned to the United Nations-mandated Sustainable Development Goals.

Big gains for Andhra farmers

Farmer distress, suicides and mass protests by farmers across India have been prompted by high production costs, unremunerative prices, depleting natural resources and the climate crisis. Andhra Pradesh is particularly impacted by the crisis.

The Government of Andhra Pradesh in 2018 launched a scale-out plan to transition six million farmers cultivating eight million hectares of land from conventional synthetic chemical agriculture to ZBNF by 2024. The aim is to make Andhra Pradesh India’s first 100 per cent natural farming state.

According to Raghuram Reddy, founder, Nilagiri Foundation:

Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are rich in fertile soil, which is best suited for farming. But due to the high cost of input, farmers are forced to take loans… As many as 90 per cent farmers are in debt in Andhra Pradesh, and each household bears an average debt of Rs 1 lakh. The cost of cultivation is lower in ZBNF for all crops; it ranges between Rs 3,000 and Rs 22,000 and the net revenue is higher by Rs 9,000-Rs 37,000 for all the crops because of the lower cost of cultivation.

Reddy added: “I saw my grandfather, a paddy farmer in a small village near Guntur, struggle to grow crops due to a huge pesticide invasion. He lost his savings in the process. The plight of farmers is similar. Our main idea is to promote sustainable agriculture through promoting organic farming, reducing cost of cultivation, producing residue-free commodities, promoting farmer producer ogranisations and helping procure and sale of farmer produce.

He added ZBNF has benefitted farmers by reducing their input costs, and thereby, reducing their debt. Farmers’ net revenue has increased.

“The ZBNF method also promotes intercropping, which helps farmers to grow more than one crop at a time. The impact of chemicals on the environment and on long term fertility of soil is devastating, but this has largely reduced in places where natural farming is being practiced,” he added.

‘Before it’s too late’

The girls are aiming to get in touch with 300 more farmers.

“The initial response has been excellent. Many farmers are happy to learn about sustainable and safer methods of farming,” said Srilakshmi Reddy.

She added the team is hopeful to take the project to a bigger stage: By making it easier for farmers to sell organic products through application as well as promoting the practise in more influential settings such as universities or schools.

“It is important to maintain balance between food security, environmental caution, farmers’ welfare and consumer satisfaction. Our vision is to help turn farming into a means of profitable livelihood instead of a means of bare subsistence,” said Potluri.

Gopalakrishnan said “serious problems just aren’t real to people until it’s too late. We hope to open people’s eyes to this.”",0
798867,New polyhouse technology to help cultivate off-season crops,"A polyhouse is a specially constructed structure like a building where specialised polythene sheet is used as a covering material under which crops can be grown in partially or fully controlled climatic conditions. It is covered with a transparent material as to permit the entry of natural light. Polyhouses are also helpful in reducing threats such as extreme heat and pest attacks in crops.

Harish Hirani, director of Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI), Durgapur, recently inaugurated a “naturally ventilated polyhouse facility” and laid the foundation stone of “retractable roof polyhouse” its Ludhiana centre. With rapidly rising temperatures due to mounting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities, crops are increasingly facing both threats — extreme heat and pest attacks — simultaneously, he said.

This is especially important for crops growing in the open field with no protection from the weather, and therefore its yield, quality, and crop maturity timings are changed. A combination of open field conditions and conventional greenhouse conditions is a more robust way to deal with climate change and associates problems in the future. Crop losses in India due to insect pests is about 15 per cent at present and this loss may increase as climate change lowers the plant defense system against insects and pests.

Conventional greenhouses have a stationary roof to reduce the effect of weather anomalies and pests. However, there are still disadvantages due to roof covering which sometimes lead to excessive heat and insufficient light (early morning). Besides this, they are also prone to insufficient levels of carbon dioxide, transpiration and water stress.

“Retractable Roof Polyhouse Technology will have an automatic retractable roof which will be operated based on weather conditions and crop requirements from the conditional database using PLC software. This ongoing development will be useful in our country with its 15 different agro-climatic zones and will help farmers to cultivate off-season crops that can fetch higher value and income”, Hirani said.

Jagdish Manikrao, a senior scientist leading the research team on the development of this technology, claimed the retractable roof would be used to manipulate sunlight quantity, quality & duration, water stress, humidity, carbon dioxide levels as well as crop and soil temperatures. (ISW)",0
798880,Agristack: The new digital push in agriculture raises serious concerns,"These concerns are about information asymmetry, data privacy and consent, profiling of farmers, mismanaged land records and corporatisation of agriculture

On April 13, 2021, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microsoft Corporation to start a pilot project in 100 villages of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The MoU requires Microsoft to create a ‘Unified Farmer Service Interface’ through its cloud computing services.

This sets in motion the ministry’s plan of creating ‘AgriStack’ (a collection of technology-based interventions in agriculture), on which everything else will be built.

The government, through this MoU, aims to provide ‘required data sets’ of farmers’ personal information to Microsoft to develop a farmer interface for ‘smart and well-organised agriculture’.

Thereafter, the ministry signed four other MoUs — with Star Agribazaar, Patanjali Organic Research Institute for agricultural management and services, Amazon Internet Services, and Esri India on June 1 for different operations under AgriStack.

On the same day, the government published a consultation paper called The India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture (IDEA), laying out a proposed framework for ‘AgriStack’, for public feedback by June 30.

Incidentally, the paper came three weeks after some 55 groups put out a letter demanding that the government make public the details on the MoU with Microsoft and go for a public consultation on the digital push in agriculture.

With these MoUs, agriculture has become the latest sector getting a boost of ‘techno solutionism’ by the government. But it has, since then, also become the latest sector to enter the whole debate about data privacy and surveillance.

Since the signing of the MoUs, several concerns related to sharing farmers’ data with private companies (the major one being Microsoft whose owner Bill Gates is said to be the largest private farmland owner in the US by an analysis done by The Land Report in January 2021), have come to light.

In all the MoUs, there are provisions under which the agriculture ministry will enter into a data sharing agreement with the private companies of the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Patanjali.

The government has now invited more technology / agritech players for collaboration, even though there is no information on the process or criteria of selecting the first five companies.

What do the MoUs say?

The MoU with Star Agribazaar mentions, among other things, ‘farmer data sanitisation’, land profiling and crop estimation using remote sensing in three districts of Kota (Rajasthan), Guna (Madhya Pradesh) and Mathura (Uttar Pradesh). It mentions building a generalised advisory platform for farmers, including mobile applications, for pre- and post-harvest advisories.

The MoU with Patanjali talks about developing a mobile application for advising farmers on soil nutrition, accurate quantification on farmer crop and yield, fertiliser recommendations, and training farmers for using this application in three districts — Haridwar (Uttarakhand), Hamirpur (Uttar Pradesh) and Morena (Madhya Pradesh).

In the MoU with Amazon Internet Services, it is discussed that the company will build a “National Agri Data Stack” that can serve as a foundational data layer on which “agri focussed solutions” will be built. It will also offer its cloud services to solution providers / partners to help build “solutions across agri value chain” and will also help agriculture related start-ups.

The Esri India MoU discusses how the company will support the ministry in establishing a ‘national agriculture geo hub’, provide the required GIS tools and technologies and create and collate farmer and other agriculture data services on GIS platform.

The development has raised serious concerns about information asymmetry, data privacy and consent, profiling of farmers, mismanaged land records and corporatisation of agriculture.

Serious concerns

The project was being implemented in the absence of a data protection legislation. It might end up being an exercise where private data processing entities may know more about a farmer’s land than the farmer himself, warned Rohin Garg, associate policy counsel, Internet Freedom Foundation.

He added:

The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is currently still with the Joint Parliamentary Committee. Despite its shortcomings, it does provide some key protections to users such as basic user rights to correction, deletion and erasure as well as consent-based mechanism for the processing of data and purpose limitation obligations. It also allows for a Data Protection Authority to administer and regulate the processing of data.

Without such safeguards, private entities would be able to exploit farmers’ data to whatever extent they wish to, Garg noted.

This information asymmetry, tilted towards the technology companies, might further exploit farmers, especially small and marginal ones.

Garg said:

One of the biggest worries is the threat of financial exploitation. We have already seen how microfinance firms have wreaked financial havoc in rural hinterlands. Now, once Fintech companies are able to collect granular data about the farmers’ operations, they may offer them usurious rates of interest precisely when they would be in the direst need for credit.

The formation of ‘Agristack’ also implies commercialisation of agriculture extension activities as they will shift into a digital and private sphere.

“The government is saying all services and advisories can be provided now digitally and privately. This is a continuation of the model where private players priced services delivery is supposed to be relied upon rather than the old model of public agriculture extension through officers on the ground,” R Ramakumar, professor, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, said.

“It also points to failure of public sector agencies in agriculture research and extension although we boast of one of the largest networks of public funded agriculture research institutions in the world,” Rajesh Krishnan, chief executive, Thirunelly Agri Producer Company Ltd, a farmer producer organisation (FPO), said.

With this, the risk of commodifying agriculture and farmer data ran high. Agristack could strengthen the asymmetry in information flow by providing all information about farmers and their farming easily to corporations who looked at farmers as a consumer base, be it agri inputs — seed, chemical fertiliser and pesticides, machinery companies or fin-tech companies and to those for whom farmers were suppliers like the food industry, garment industry, etc, Krishnan said.

He also pointed out that FPOs had become the new data collection points as well market channels for the seed and agrochemical industry as well as agri commodity traders.

This data can be sold by the companies to private input dealers and input companies to aid their marketing network.

“For example, if diseases are being reported from one region and this information is available to pesticide companies, they can improve their marketing in that region. So, this kind of commodification of the data is the revenue model which will be broadly followed,” Ramakumar said.

Although there is a non-disclosure agreement in the MoU, there is also a clause on ‘limitation of liability’ which essentially provides indemnity for breach of contract.

“The net result of all this legalese is essentially that farmers’ data is being provided to the companies at their word with little consequence for breaking it,” Nachiket Udupa, associated with the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, said.

Agendra Kumar, Esri India’s managing director, addressed some of the concerns. He said:

As a part of the MoU, we will set up a Geo hub, which is a GIS system where all the data can be brought together and analytics can be run to create valuable insights for the agriculture department and the farmers. By setting up a geo hub as a ‘proof of concept’, it will be easy to understand how this technology can help in improving the welfare of the farmers and their incomes. We will share the technology with the government and it will be their prerogative on how they want to use the data generated with that technology.

Kumar added that agriculture was an area where the potential for digital technology and GIS was immense. He also said some state governments were already using their technology.

Down To Earth reached out to Vivek Agarwal, additional secretary (digital) and representatives of the remaing four companies. DTE is yet to receive a response.

Experts agree that data and technology can provide a fillip to farmers but only when they remain at the top of this stack that the government is building.

798915,IIT-K scientists design mobile pesticide sprayer that runs on solar energy,"The device will save labour and time for small and marginal farmers

Scientists from IIT Kharagpur have developed a mobile pest-control device that runs on solar power. The semi-automated device will reduce the labour of farmers who have to manually spray pesticides or use fossil-fuel based machines for the same. The innovation, meant mostly for small and marginal farmers, will also ensure pesticides are not wasted and the distribution is uniform.

Prevention of pests during different growth stages of crops is important to increase yield. But the process is labour and time-intensive. In smaller tracts of lands, the farmers usually use knapsack sprayers in which the cultivator has to carry the entire volume of pesticide on their back while moving around the field to spray.

“This impacts the efficiency of spraying as it depends on the skill of the operator leading to non-uniformity in spraying,” the scientists said in a statement to the press.

The device resembles a vegetable cart with three wheels and a roof of solar panels. The main system consists of a propelling unit fitted with a liquid storage tank and a DC motor-operated pump to pressure the liquid to be sprayed, the press note described.

Multiple numbers of spray nozzles are mounted on a boom fitted to the front of the machine. An operator is required to control the movement of the spraying unit.

“It can be easily operated in the field using solar energy with a maximum speed of two kilometres per hour, and can cover a width of 1.5 metres at a time with a field efficiency of 81 per cent, thus saving time, human involvement and chemicals,” remarked Hifjur Raheman, a professor in the department of agriculture, food engineering at the university and a member of the team that created the device.

Raheman conceptualised and designed the product with Anup Behera Rahul K and PBS Bhadoria from the department. They have filed a patent for the sprayer and it is ready for commercialisation.

About 82 per cent of the country’s farming community is categorised as small or marginal, according to Food and Agriculture Organization. These farmers have less than two hectares of land, according to the Union Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.

With the view to improve the condition of such farmers and to double their income by 2022, the government is focusing on technological innovations, read the institute’s press statement. “This is an open call to the technical institutions in India to deliver in the field of precision agricultural technologies. In the IIT system, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an agricultural and food engineering department. Hence it is our foremost responsibility to answer this call,"" remarked Virendra K Tewari, director, IIT Kharagpur.",0
798927,Indian research can help cut nitrogen fertiliser waste,"Indian scientists manage to identify phenotypes, visibly identifiable features that determine the efficiency with which cultivars use nitrogen

A group of Indian scientists have found a way to improve crops by reducing wastage of nitrogen fertilisers applied to them. They were able to identify phenotypes, or visibly identifiable features that determine the efficiency with which cultivated rice varieties (cultivars) use nitrogen.

This efficiency is known as nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE).

The group, lead by N Raghuram of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, also identified genes associated with the identifiable features that can improve crops further.

The research involving interdisciplinary research in biotechnology, crop physiology, agronomy, soil science, statistics and bioinformatics was published in journal Frontiers in Plant Science January 20, 2021.

Crops generally use up 30 per cent of nitrogen fertiliser applied; the rest seeps into the environment, harming health and adding to climate change.

Agriculture leads to 70 per cent of nitrous oxide emissions in India. Of this, 77 per cent is contributed by fertilisers, mostly urea, according to the Indian Nitrogen Assessment published in 2017.

This greenhouse gas (GHG) is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. It has replaced methane as the second-largest component of GHG emissions from Indian agriculture in past 15 years.

Cereals consume over 69 per cent of nitrogen fertilisers in India; rice tops the list with 37 per cent, followed by wheat (24 per cent).

The scientists’ group compared three each of high- and low-NUE rice cultivars with normal or low doses of fertilisers like nitrate and urea as the sole nitrogen source. Nitrogen-use efficient cultivars tend to germinate and flower slower they found. Such varieties grow tall and deep, have a higher biomass and take longer for harvest; but they yield more on relatively less nitrogen.

The group also reported 34 genes associated with NUE for potential crop improvement. They evaluated 25 phenotypes for their nitrogen response using four different applications of the element.

“Many scientists described on one or two visible or phenotypic features that change in a plant in response to nitrogen-fertiliser, but nobody experimentally distinguished N-response from NUE,” said Raghuram, who chairs International Nitrogen Initiative (INI).

Crop-improvement mostly focuses on reducing crop duration and biomass to maximise output, he added:

Our work indicates that unless scientists bring NUE traits together with yield traits through breeding, we may be gaining yield at the cost of NUE. We also need to worry about whether this is also true for other inputs such as phosphorus, water, potassium, sulphur, etc.

India was the first country to study 25 phenotypic features in any crop, comparing different cultivars, nitrogen-forms and doses, said Narendra Sharma, the first author of the research paper. “We found that only 20 of them respond to nitrogen-fertiliser while only eight actually account for NUE.”

The findings in rice will be relevant for more cereals as well as other crops but need to be validated; the statistical and bioinformatic tools used can be also be used for difficult crop traits, he claimed.

“No one had clearly demonstrated how to deal with NUE when different forms of nitrogen-fertilisers are used. Scientific literature is dominated by developed countries that mostly use ammonium nitrate, while most developing countries use urea; we had to compare both,” said Vetury Sitaramam, who earlier taught biotechnology at University of Pune and is a co-leader of the study. According to him:

The discovery of the phenotype not only lays the foundation for crop improvement, but also for exciting research on the underlying mechanisms of NUE. We have already hinted earlier that respiration could play a crucial role in NUE but it needs to be investigated further.

NUE is calculated as a ratio between nitrogen used and harvest: A higher number denotes low wastage.

With the efficiency on the decline, farmers use more fertiliser in the hope of raising yield. This in turn worsens NUE.

As paddy consumes the most nitrogen fertiliser in India, any improvement in its NUE will be a win-win, said Tapan Adhya, former director of National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack and current co-director (science) of South Asian Nitrogen Hub project. He was involved in the research.",0
798951,Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2021: How poor regulation threatens aquaculture,"There are no regulations or institutional setup for freshwater aquaculture

Aquaculture is the world’s fastest-developing food production sector and represents an important impediment to food production. Fish are the most-traded food commodity in international trade with an export value of nearly $150 billion (around Rs 11.2 lakh crore).

The globalisation of aquatic animal products and the rise of aquaculture as a primary supplier of the world’s aquatic food supply have led to an intensification of culture practices. This has created new market opportunities for farmed aquatic animals but has simultaneously facilitated the easier spread of pathogens and diseases.

Diseases are a primary constraint to aquaculture and a variety of drugs are used to control the diseases. However, the imprudent use of these drugs in aquaculture is a contributing factor in the spread of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). Continuous use of antibiotics for alleviating bacterial diseases in aquaculture has led to ‘pseudo-durability’ and their omnipresence in the environment, which has caused the development of selective pressure on the microbial community.

Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) formed under selective pressure can develop into an environmental reservoir of antibiotic-resistant genes. Aquaculture systems and fish farms have been observed as the ‘hotspots for AMR genes’ and hence the assessment of resistome, the AMR gene assemblage in aquaculture, is an important topic of research worldwide.

Since the majority of antimicrobials used in aquaculture are also employed in human medicine, their use has a significant impact on the development of AMR in other ecological niches, particularly the human environment. Researchers have reported an increase in the frequency of serious infections and treatment failures as a result of antimicrobial resistance being transferred from aquaculture to humans through the consumption of aquaculture products.

Aquaculture in India, particularly shrimp and carp aquaculture, has been playing a significant role in the agriculture sector. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics are pervasive in both brackishwater and freshwater aquaculture.

The use of aquadrugs is common in major fish-producing states like Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. The use of antibiotics is slowly rising in states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.

There are standards, guidelines and an institution to manage the use of antibiotics and pharmacologically active substances in export-oriented brackishwater aquaculture. But there are no regulations or institutional setup for freshwater aquaculture, which account for two-thirds of India's fish production.

In other words, while we are protecting the health of our export customers, we have no concern for domestic consumers.

Besides food-fish production, antibiotics have got large scale applications in ornamental fish production. In recent years, the increased development of ornamental fish culture in many states has opened up problems of disease and water quality deterioration in ornamental fish.

Most of the ornamental fish varieties are normally procured from neighbouring Asian countries to India mainly through legal and illegal means. Ornamental fish have been the source of exotic bacterial and viral pathogens that have mandated strict quarantine regulations.

A wide range of antimicrobials have found their way into Indian ornamental fish culture since there are no strict guidelines in ornamental fish. Most of the aquaculture farmers are small-scale entrepreneurs with farm sizes less than two hectares. This creates a situation where the farmers may not be able to afford the investment needed to install biosecurity measures in farms.

Most of the shrimp farms get their seed from bio-secured hatcheries. However, several antibiotics are used at the time of transport with an erroneous assumption that they can reduce the mortality in seeds during transportation.



Poor regulation

A large part of the antibiotic use is not supervised by any scientific personnel and is generally based on the experience of fellow farmers. The policy of the European Union to reject consignments of shrimp, which has the presence of antibiotic residues has had a definite impact on the use of antibiotics in shrimp aquaculture.

The Marine Products Exports Development Authority is now conducting regular inspections of shrimp products, to ensure that it complies with export standards laid down by various international agencies. But this inspection is confined to the products meant for the export market and those meant for local consumption is largely unregulated.

Farmers have brought down the use of antibiotics through several biosecurity measures. There is very little antibiotic use in cage farming due to the complexity involved in administration. But in aquaculture farming other than shrimp, there is significant use of antibiotics. This is because the products are meant for local consumption and the market is highly unregulated.

In integrated farming, poultry waste and bird droppings are used as fish feeds. This gives rise to a peculiar situation in which there is antibiotic contamination of the aquaculture environment, even without direct use of antibiotics since poultry farming uses a high amount of antibiotics.

Vibrio bacteria has been isolated from coastal aquacultural areas showing a high prevalence of AMR. Aeromonas spp (species plural) depicting multi-drug resistance (MDR) have been isolated from the freshwater aquaculture systems.

The southern states of India, particularly the wetlands of coastal Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, are considered to harbour high levels of ARB. Two-thirds of the samples drawn from fish and shellfish obtained from the markets have Salmonella strains resistant to at least two antibiotics.

These results reflect the poor implementation of the existing legislative provisions, as well as the polypharmacy practised in the aquaculture sector. Such emerging AMR and MDR rates in India are an alarming situation.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has placed an extensive ban on the use of antibiotics and several pharmacologically active substances in fisheries. The long-term impact of the use of antibiotics for aquaculture not only has ramifications for the emergence of resistance in indigenous bacteria but also has a yet unmeasured impact on the ecology and the environment.

Due to the existence of stringent legislative provisions to contain the inappropriate and non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, it is expected that the problem of AMR in the aquaculture sector should be smaller compared to other sectors. However, the monitoring and implementation lack a roadmap, making it difficult to form a policy.

There is an absence of a ‘One Health’ approach to AMR containment at a policy level, as the focus is more on human health issues and the scope of the problem in the veterinary and aquaculture sectors, although acknowledged, is not outlined in granular details.

Few regulations and legislative measures are available against the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in food animals. Limited legislations are available for the control of antibiotics in the livestock sector, although some legislative tools are available for fisheries and poultry raised exclusively for export.

Improving hygiene, using enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics and acids to improve health and utilising bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophages as substitutes for antibiotics might be good methods to promote fish growth and decrease infectious diseases in them. As of now, stringent monitoring on antimicrobial use in Indian aquaculture is deemed necessary for the betterment of human health and aquaculture.

798953,"Organic farming can lead to good yields, even in an intensively farmed area","A survey in Haryana last year found that 45 per cent of 218 organic farmers got yields for wheat better than the state official average yield

The relative merit of organic farming is recognised. Still, it is usually recommended only for areas of low chemical usage and not for intensively farmed areas such as those where the Green Revolution took place in the 1960s like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.

The findings of various quarters, ranging from the Swaminathan Commission to the Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), have showed that organic farming can give comparable yield.

Yet, these quarters hold on to this ‘niche role’ view on organic farming. The prime reason for this is the deeply-held belief that organic farming is basically low-yielding, in spite of merits like sustainability, health and environmental benefits.

A 2020 survey of farmers practicing organic farming in Haryana, a core area of the Green Revolution’, negates this. Only a telephonic survey was possible due to the raging novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Then too, only limited data could be collected in a telephonic survey.

Most farmers reported yield levels to be comparable even in the initial stages of transition. Hence, Kudrati Kheti Abhiyan, Haryana (KKA, translated as Natural farming Mission) collected yield data for just wheat as it had proved to be the most difficult crop to farm organically.

It was found that some 45 per cent of 218 organic farmers got better than official average yield for Haryana. Most organic farmers sow the C-306 variety of wheat, which is the preferred variety for domestic consumption in Haryana.

This variety, released by the ICAR, is considered to be a traditional one. It has an official average yield of 26 quintals per hectare (against the official average wheat yield for Haryana, which is slightly higher than 46 quintals).

Hence, two benchmarks were used in this survey — 26 quintals for traditional varieties, whether C-306 or others and 46 quintals for high yielding varieties (HYV) such as 711.

The value of companion crops at their respective Minimum Support Price (MSP) was converted to an equivalent wheat yield. Based on these calculations, it emerged that 45 per cent organic farmers were getting better than comparable average yields under chemical farming.

Even in terms of HYV alone, which is generally sown by new inexperienced organic farmers, some 18 per cent of farmers were getting better than the state average yield of wheat. Survey data from 2019 had, in fact, yielded better results though the total number of farmers was much smaller.

Why this difference?

What explains this difference between the popular perception about organic farming’s yield potential and the survey results? A part of the reason is the diversity in organic farming.

No use of artificial chemicals is an essential element of organic farming. Yet organic farming is not limited to this. ‘Comprehensive organic farming’ goes beyond the source of crop nutrition and involves multiple agronomical changes.

Often, even organic farmers take a narrow view of organic farming and continue with mono-cropping, conventional irrigation and composting methods, which are less-than-optimal.

Moreover, those organic farmers, who develop their own market, do not feel the need to increase the yield and rather focus on processing, packaging and marketing. Similarly, part-time organic farmers or those producing for self-consumption have no imperative to or are not able to increase yield.

The KKA situation was different. As the target area was spread all over the state, it was not possible to extend marketing support to thinly spread farmers.

Without marketing support, a livelihood farmer can expand organic farming beyond self-consumption only if there is no yield decline or it is so minimal that it is compensated by a fall in the cost of production.

Hence, if KKA had to make headway without extending marketing support, it had to perforce focus on getting comparable yield. Moreover, low-yielding organic farming, if accompanied by price premiums, can make organic farming attractive for individual farmers but it would not impress policy makers who have to ensure national food security.

However, initially, yield levels particularly in wheat, were pretty low. A review indicated that except for stopping the usage of chemical inputs and burning of crop residue, even serious organic farmers had made no changes in their agronomic practices.

They neither found it feasible nor necessary to stop mono-cropping or practice mixed green manuring, etc. However, during an ‘exposure visit’ outside Haryana in 2016, they found these measures being implemented and yielding results.

It was then that they started practicing ‘comprehensive organic farming’. And once their yield levels improved, other farmers too changed their organic practices.

For the same reasons which forced KKA to not extend marketing support, it focused on self-reliant organic farming rather than rely on external supply of bio-inputs.

As KKA was not functioning in a limited contiguous area but was thinly spread all over the state, it could not ensure regular supply of external bio-inputs to isolated farmers. Hence, it focused on in situ preparation of bio-inputs as well as use of only replicable methods.

Any method, which required heavy investment, was not recommended because it could not be easily replicated. This approach underlies the publication of a new edition of a manual of self-reliant organic farming edited by farmers wherein all recommended methods have been applied by Haryana farmers.

Will this success of organic farming in the core Green Revolution belt convince policy makers to mainstream organic farming? One is not sure.

In a September 2021 public hearing, when these survey results from Haryana were sought to be corroborated from the official yield data of the Government of India, the reaction of an official representative was revealing.

He thought that there had been a mix-up and yield levels pertained to hectares and not acres. This implied that correct yield levels were 40 per cent of the officially reported yield levels.

But agriculture scientists should not be presumptive. If the Haryana survey fails the strict ‘scientificity’ test (though it does not as survey data is widely used), they must get out and do their crop cutting experiments on the fields of organic farmers.

798968,Organic and conservation farming boost multifunctionality of ecosystems: Study,"Organic farming has a 46-51 per cent lower global warming potential

One of the main challenges facing agriculture is to produce sufficient food with minimal environmental impact.

Agricultural practices followed in conservation agriculture and organic farming — integrated plant protection, crop rotation and the use of organic inputs — helped in reducing the productivity-environmental protection dilemma, according to a study published August 20, 2021.

Organic farming also had a reduced environmental impact, with a 46-51 per cent lower global warming potential and an 80-85 per cent reduced aquatic ecotoxicity potential per hectare, the report said.

Agricultural practices influence a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. The study assessed the overall performance of important cropping systems in Europe within adapted ecosystem services and using the ecosystem multifunctionality — the ability of ecosystems to provide multiple functions and services simultaneously.

Researchers evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic and ecological performance of the arable cropping systems in Europe — organic, conservation and conventional agriculture. The results were published in the report titled Organic and conservation agriculture promote ecosystem multifunctionality in the journal Science Advances.

Nine agroecosystem goods and services were used in the study for multifunctionality assessments: Biodiversity conservation, soil conservation, erosion control, water and air pollution control, food production, income, work efficiency, and financial independence.

Conventional systems with intensive tillage showed improved performance and it can be explained by way of increased weed control and a better availability of applied nutrients.

Weed cover was six to nine times higher in the organic systems, whereas reduced and no tillage had a negative impact on summer crops like maize and beans, the study found.

The use of mineral fertilisers and herbicides in conventional systems led to higher yields for wheat and maize compared to organic systems. The differences between conventional and organic systems were less pronounced for legume crops like field beans and grass-clover ley.

The loss of productivity in organic systems did not mean reduced economic performance, as the highest income was obtained under organic production, according to the report.

Conservation agriculture (no tillage or reduced tillage) and organic farming positively influenced most soil quality variables.

Organic farming — and reduced tillage intensity in particular — had a positive impact on soil biodiversity and the abundance of macro- and micro-biota. Beneficial soil biota, such as earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, were promoted under organic management and conservation agriculture.

Soil fungi and bacteria responded positively to conservation tillage and was associated with soil carbon content increase, the research showed.

Organic management and conservation tillage significantly reduced sediment delivery and contributed greatly to soil protection.

An agricultural system should be able to provide the desired balance of services — food production, regulation services (soil, water and climate protection), supporting services (biodiversity and soil quality conservation) as well as providing for an ensured income and suitable working conditions.

The researchers used a six-year dataset from the Farming System and Tillage (FAST) experiment and compared the agronomical, ecological and economic impacts of four arable cropping systems — conventional intensive tillage, conventional no tillage, organic intensive tillage and organic reduced tillage.

Conventional no tillage and organic reduced tillage systems are considered to reflect conservation agriculture, as the three pillars of conservation agriculture — minimum tillage, six-year crop rotation and permanent soil cover with crop residues and cover crops — are largely fulfilled.

A study published in Agronomy for Sustainable Development December 18, 2018 demonstrated that both organic farming and conservation agriculture reduced soil losses and showed that reduced tillage practices was a major improvement in organic farming with respect to soil erosion control.

The largest adoption of conservation agriculture is seen in North and South America, followed by Australia and New Zealand, Asia, Russia, Ukraine, Europe and Africa, the researchers noted.

Organic farming is in a nascent stage in India (2 per cent of the net sown area) and states need to step up their act to increase organic farming coverage, Down to Earth reported in September 2020. A major part of the area under organic cultivation is concentrated only in a handful of states.

An increase in environmental benefits tends to be coupled with a decrease in productivity. Future studies should focus on main barriers limiting yield to reduce the gap between conventional and organic agriculture and enhance ecosystem multifunctionality, the report suggested.

The total area of cultivable land globally devoted to organic and no tillage systems are currently 1.4 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively. To increase environmental protection and delivery of supporting and regulating services, the total area for organic and no tillage systems needs to be substantially expanded.",0
798994,New targets to protect biodiversity must include farmers and agriculture,"Africa’s protected areas cover an area of 20.4 million km² or 15.1% of the landmass. But experts say this isn’t enough.

The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity is a treaty that aims to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of a country’s natural resources, or biological diversity. This is a general strategy that all countries must then adopt at the local level.

The Convention – a legally-binding international treaty – is currently negotiating new targets for the next 30 years. Decisions are made by parties to the convention, made up of 196 countries, supported by a range of observers including NGOs, researchers and academics.

Read more: We're coming up with a new set of targets to protect the natural world. Here's how

But the Convention is about to make a mistake: it concentrates primarily on protected areas when it should also recognise the potential of managing agricultural landscapes for biodiversity.

In its “modified zero draft”, released in October, of 20 targets only one refers to “agricultural and other managed ecosystems”. But its focus is essentially on biodiversity for food. It misses the point that agro-ecosystems can contribute to conservation through providing habitat to wild species and harbouring fragments of natural habitat, such as forests and wetlands.

Africa’s protected areas cover an area of 20.4 million km² or 15.1% of the landmass. But experts say this isn’t enough. For instance, 7% of Kenya’s land is formally protected but between 20-30% of contiguous habitat is needed to maintain populations of “umbrella” species. Protecting these species indirectly protects many other species within its habitat.

Given population pressure, it is not politically feasible to increase the extent of protected areas. The question is how will Africa provide space for its wildlife and food production?

Agriculture dominates sub-Saharan African economies. It contributes on average 15% of total GDP, covers vast tracts of land and is often the main source of livelihoods in rural areas.

We argue that the new framework must recognise the importance of agriculture for conservation. And that the best way to protect Africa’s biodiversity is to integrate conservation measures on working lands. This will also create jobs and income opportunities for farming communities.

An international treaty that draws attention away from this huge stock of land – where biodiversity conservation could be actively supported with investments into mixed farming regimes – runs the risk of skewing policies. It will also miss the opportunity to bring ministries of agriculture and environment together to tackle one of the biggest challenge of the decade.

Land sharing that works

The Convention on Biological Diversity has traditionally seen agriculture as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. It has promoted the protection of natural ecosystems by concentrating on preventing further expansion of agriculture. But evidence shows that farms that share landscapes with wild nature, such as remnant forests and trees, benefit from the ecosystem services provided.

Farming systems that integrate conservation combine a diversity of crops, animals and trees – with different spatial and seasonal arrangements – and mimic natural water and nutrient processes.

This creates less need for artificial inputs like fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides. These farming systems are in line with the traditional farming practices of small holders in sub-Saharan Africa and integrate well with traditional knowledge and practices.

There are examples of the successful relationship between farmers, agriculture and conservation all over the continent.

For instance in Ethiopia, cereal farmers use nearby forests to feed livestock. The livestock roam the forest during the day and return to farms at night, providing farmers with organic fertiliser.

This is important for smallholder farmers because the availability and accessibility of agricultural inputs – such as fertilisers – remain low. Farms close to forests have better soil fertility and produced more nutritious food than those part of an intensified cereal landscape. And forests benefit because they’re not being cleared for agriculture.

Another example is the 400 km2 Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya’s Laikipia County. Ol Pejeta is home to 130 black rhinos and 7,500 cattle. It has increased the black rhino population by 100% in 10 years. In 2019, it employed 700 people and generated US$1.4 million from livestock production and US$4.8 million from tourism.

The business model is multi-dimensional. By optimising tourism and livestock production, the conservancy can generate higher economic returns per hectare than by specialising on one dimension. Their success demonstrates that one key to wildlife conservation in Kenya is not to protect more areas, but turn conservation into a profitable business.

Grey areas

The debate about whether agriculture should be kept separate from conservation shouldn’t presented be as a black or white choice. There are many shades of grey in land-use planning.

“Land sparing” – where agriculture is kept separate – is supposed to address trade-offs between productivity and conservation by maximising productivity in one place while leaving other places in “natural” condition. One critique of this is that in most cases crop productivity is the sole criterion of performance, not managing the trade-offs between economic, social and environmental objectives.

Other studies, show that incorporating other criteria – for example livestock productivity, sustainability, resilience, equitability, ecosystem service provision – may portray a different situation: one less dominated by short term trade-offs, but rather by synergies where one land use might support other objectives. This would contribute to more food security in the long run.

What are the implications?

International biodiversity policy will have impact on land use over the next 30 years. Countries will plan investments around policies they have signed. Donors will align with international commitments. Developing countries will find that funding is channelled through instruments aligned with global policies.

International funding instruments need to be available so that African governments can ensure their farming communities live and prosper in harmony with nature. African farmers deserve a convention that recognises the importance of protected natural landscapes but also of managing wild biodiversity sustainably in farming landscapes.

799024,"How Indian states are promoting organic, natural farming","States such as Odisha and Karnataka have started initiatives such as procurement of organic produce and linkages with PDS, ICDS and other schemes

This is the final in the four-part series on the state of organic farming in India

Indian states essentially depend on the Union government’s schemes to promote organic and natural farming. Some states also utilise funds from other schemes such as Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture to do the job.

A few states, on the other hand, walked the extra mile and started initiatives of their own.

Chhattisgarh, for example, recently took initiatives to promote rural livelihoods along with organic farming. The new Godhan Nyay scheme was launched by Chhattisgarh government in July 2020. The scheme aims to increase income of farmers and cattle ranchers, promote organic compost, reduce chemical fertiliser usage and improve soil health.

It also proposes to purchase cattle dung at Rs 2 per kilogram, convert it to vermin compost and make it available to farmers at Rs 8 per kg.

Then there is Odisha: It introduced an organic farming policy in 2018 and is now planning to launch an organic mission. The central government allotted Sri Sri University in the state to promote organic farming in five districts and make 30 model organic clusters.

The state recently decided to promote organic farming in seven districts through integrated nutrient management — that encompasses promotion of organic clusters initiative under Odisha Integrated Irrigation Project for Climate Resilient — according to Debraj Mohanty, a state bio-chemist of Odisha.

It also started a special programme to promote millets in tribal areas in 2017, which has so far covered about 23,000 hectares. “Under this, farmers are encouraged to adopt organic farming practices to produce millets,” said Dinesh Balam, who is associated with the programme.

Millets are procured by the state government and linked with the Public Distribution System (PDS), which aims to link it with state nutrition programmes such as Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), mid-day meal, and Integrated Tribal Development Agency welfare hostels.

From September 1, 2020, ragi laddus have been upscaled under ICDS to all 13 blocks of Keonjhar district of Odisha. Malkangiri became the first district to form a ‘committee on agro-ecology and agro-biodiversity’ in May 2020.

Uttarkhand is another example of an Indian state taking maters in its own hands. It was the first state to have an organic farming policy in 2000. A dedicated organic commodity board, a nodal state agency to promote organic farming, was established in 2003.

The board identifies commodity-specific clusters, areas and provides them technical know-how on organic agriculture. The state had 128,000 ha under organic cultivation as on November, 2019, which is around 18 per cent of its net sown area. The plan is to make it a 100 per cent organic state.

“Uttarakhand passed the Organic Agriculture Act, 2019, and declared 10 of its blocks fully organic. These blocks are spread across Dunda, Pratapnagar, Jaihari khal, Jakholi, Augustmuni, Ukhimath, Dewal, Salt, Betalghat and Munsyari. It criminalises the sale and purchase of chemical fertilisers and pesticides in select blocks notified under organic farming,” according to AK Upadhyay, joint director, organic farming, agriculture department, Uttarakhand.

Under the Act, non-profits, private entities and traders will engage in export market and processing of organic products will be regulated. Buyers will be registered for free.

The Act also aims to help simplify the organic certification process and promote brand ‘Uttarakhand Organic’. Upadhyay said the state has its own organic certification agency accredited by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.

Vinay Kumar, managing director, Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board, said: “Organic commodity board connects farmers with buyers by organising buyer-seller meets. It also facilitates farmers for direct sale by organising organic haats, fairs and exhibitions, organic kitchens and organic outlets”.

He added that the organic board started with five commodities in 2005-06 and increased to 22 commodities in 2019-20 with sale amounting to Rs 11.79 crore.

“To help farmers, weekly organic haats are organised on Sundays and Thursdays in prime locations of Dehradun,” Kumar said. The plan is to have 13 organic outlets in every district specifically on pilgrim and tourism route. By the end of 2021-22, 1,500-plus organic outlets are planned.

He added that the state’s new initiative ‘Haritima-The Bamboo huts initiative’ would promote eco-tourism in Uttarakhand. The same has been started with six bamboo huts and will be expanded by 12 by the end of 2020.

The aim of the initiative is to develop these bamboo huts as major eco-tourism hub. To support farmers, organic, makeshift kitchens will be promoted for tourists.

Karnataka’s case is different: The civil society and farmers’ movement have played a critical role there to promote natural farming without any government support, according to Chamarasa Mali Patil, honorary president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), a farmers’ organisation.

He said the KRRS came forward and engaged natural farming experts like Subhash Palekar to organise multiple trainings for farmers. Various farmers leaders volunteered in mass mobilisation for natural farming training camps organised across the state.

The need for natural farming was felt by farmers to get rid of huge debt burdens because of increased cost of cultivation. Besides, natural farming has environmental and health benefits and is a good alternative against costly and harmful chemical fertilisers and pesticides, Patil said.

In 2017, Karnataka brought a new organic farming policy. The new policy focuses on providing value-chain linkages between producers and consumers along with promoting sustainable organic production systems. Policy aims to convert at least 10 per cent of the cultivable area into organic by 2022.

However, as on November 2019, state organic area was 111,000 ha, which is 1.1 per cent of its net sown area.

The Karnataka government facilitated formation and registration of organic farmers associations under the Savayava Bhagya Yojane in 2013-14 through select non-profits. Assistance is also provided to establish organic manure production units, collection of cattle urine and dung, processing and value addition of organic produce.

Since 2015-16, Karnataka has facilitated setting up such organic farmers’ associations throughout the state.

Each farmer association has 70-150 farmers. These associations are federated into 15 regional cooperative organic farmers’ federations covering all 30 districts. They engage in procurement, processing and market related activities with some financial assistance from state.

Since 2017-18, a market-based crop specific organic cluster development has been promoted by the state to develop linkages between farmers and consumers by strengthening supply chain mechanism.

Ashok Tubachi, organic farming advisory committee member in the Karnataka government said: “We are procuring organic produce directly from certified organic farmers groups and selling through various outlets”. He added that the federation provides premium price to farmers. For example, an extra premium of Rs 500 per tonne is provided to sugarcane farmers.

“However, due to lack of revolving funds, we are not able to procure the entire crop produce from farmers,” he added.

Krupa, the president of a Karnataka state-level regional farmers’ federation said the body has 300 outlets and sells the produce to multiple private companies such as Big basket, Jai Keshav exporter, Mera Kisan, Kisan Bharti, etc. The federation also exports the organic produce to countries such as Australia, the United States, Canada and European Union.

Suresh Desai, a renowned organic farmer said “such federations play an important role in helping farmers sell their produce, and that they should be formed across the country to promote natural farming.""

“The state aims to become the millet capital of India. It has started distributing of millets through the PDS, wherein the grains are sourced and distributed locally. Organic millet stores are promoted by the government and coming up across the state,” a senior agriculture department official of Karnataka said.

The state government had also made an announcement of purchasing ragi and jowar with a bonus of 20-25 per cent above the minimum support price from farmers. The same has, however, not been implemented on ground so far.

Karnataka recently launched the Raitha Siri Scheme, under which all millet growers would get cash incentives worth Rs 10,000 per hectare. While several millet growers are not certified, a significant percentage grows millets organically. “Our federation provides 15 per cent premium to farmers for millets, pulses and oilseeds,” said Krupa.

States such as Punjab have not launched any dedicated scheme for organic farming but have been supporting organic farmers by purchasing their crops through Punjab Agri Export Corporation and selling it abroad.

There is a strong need to upscale such initiatives at a larger scale to promote organic and natural farming. Other states should learn or undertake their own initiatives.

Chemical-based agriculture faces sustainability issues and causes damage to people and the planet’s health. Promotion of organic and natural farming will lead to a win-win situation for people and the planet and will contribute to help achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",0
799079,Applying modern tech to agriculture,"Farmers today can use the benefits of the technological revolution to increase their yields from farming and livestock rearing

It is possible to monitor and control the irrigation of crops through a smartphone. Photo: Getty Images

Modern agriculture is driven by continuous improvements in digital tools and data as well as collaborations among farmers and researchers across the public and private sectors.

During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, India could achieve self-sufficiency in food grain production by using modern methods of agriculture like better quality of seeds, proper irrigation, chemical fertilisers and pesticides.

As time passed, more technological advances appeared in agriculture. The tractor was introduced, followed by new tillage and harvesting equipment, irrigation and air seeding technology, all leading to higher yields and improved quality of the food and fibre that was grown.

It is possible for farmers to utilise scientific data and technology to improve crop yields and keep themselves up-to-date with cutting edge methods of farming.

Here are some examples of how modern technology can be used to improve agriculture:

1. Monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems via smartphone

Mobile technology is playing an important role in monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems.

With this modern technology, a farmer can control his irrigation systems from a phone or computer instead of driving to each field.

Moisture sensors in the ground are able to communicate information about the level of moisture present at certain depths in the soil.

2. Ultrasounds for livestock

Ultrasound is not only for checking on baby animals in the womb. It also can be used to discover what quality of meat might be found in an animal before it goes to the market.

The testing of DNA helps producers to identify animals with good pedigrees and other desirable qualities. This information can also be used to help the farmer to improve the quality of his herds.

3. Usage of mobile technology and cameras

Some farmers and ranchers use apps like ‘Foursquare’ to keep tabs on employees. They also put up cameras around the farm.

Livestock managers are wiring up their barn feedlots and pastures with cameras that send images back to the central location like an office or home computer. They can keep a closer eye on the animals when they are away or home for the night.

4. Crop Sensors

Crop sensors help apply fertilisers in a very effective manner, maximising uptake. They sense how your crop is feeling and reduce the potential leaching and runoff into ground water.

Instead of making a prescription fertiliser map for a field before you go out to apply it, crop sensors tell application equipment how much to apply in real time.

Optical sensors are able to see how much fertiliser a plant may need, based on the amount of light reflected back to the sensor.

Vision about modern agriculture

Nearly everyone working on the future of modern agriculture is focused on efficiency. A wide range of technologies will enable the transition of modern agriculture in the field.

Some technologies will need to be developed specifically for agriculture, while other technologies already developed for other areas could be adapted to the modern agricultural domain such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and machine vision.

If modern agriculture is applied widely in the near future, millions of farmers will be able to benefit from the acquisition of real-time farm information.

Farmers need not spend significant amount of time on acquiring farm data and will have access to disaster warnings and weather information when a disaster event occurs.

It is difficult to predict the future of technology in agriculture but there are many promising trends and pilot projects.

799080,How big data can boost agricultural growth,"Data tools can help determine changes required to maintain yields and meet food demands

In agriculture, big data is often viewed as a combination of technology and analytics that can collect and compile novel data and process it in a more useful and timely way to assist decision making.

Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning statistics and database system.

Precision agriculture’s main objective is to ensure profitability, efficiency, and sustainability using the big data gathered to guide both immediate and future decision-making. This could cover everything — from when it is best to apply fertilizers, chemical and seeds, to from where in the field it is best to apply a rate.

According to agriculture funders, the big data practice comprises capturing relevant data from a huge number of sources, collecting it today and translating it into actionable information to improve business processes and solve problems at scale and speed.

Real-time insights to help performance optimisation advance analytics can show how farmers are utilising their inputs and what adaptations are required to take account of emerging weather events or disease outbreaks.

To achieve this, advanced algorithms are needed to swiftly unlock the highly valuable insights for products to perform well on an ongoing basis despite changing conditions. The development of highly-specific customer segmentation set has become possible to tailor product offerings to meet customer needs.

For instance, if Black Grass becomes problematic in a given region, suppliers can deploy big data techniques such as real-time micro-segmentation of customers to target promotional and marketing activities, thus facilitating better utilisation of marketing spends. Big data connectivity has proven itself a key asset for companies seeking a competitive advantage over their competitors.

Benefits include faster unearthing of valuable insights and the ability to develop and adapt products that meet specific customer needs on an ongoing basis.

Robots can play an important role in control, but it can be expected that the role of humans in analysis and planning is increasingly assisted by machines so that the cyber physical cycle becomes almost autonomous.

Considering its potential, various agri-tech companies are providing their services to the producers to make the practice more approachable and available. Hardware-wise there are various sensors collecting the available data.

In this range, we can encounter autonomous vehicle devices farmers place in the ground to measure soil moisture and nutrient, predictive weather stations and image-capturing satellites and drones mapping out land and measuring crop health.

These insights are extremely important since they tell the farmer when and how much to irrigate a field, crop health, weather predictions, pest infestations and even drought conditions. Considering the increasing labor shortages in the sector the capacity for big data analysis that lessens the need for physical manpower is of great advantage for agriculture.

Role of data analysis in agriculture

Application of science and new technologies is currently lacking within this space. Many companies and start-ups are looking to fill this information gap. If Big Data has made serious advancement in fields like information technology, healthcare, education and even sports, there is an obvious need for it in the agricultural industry too.

While the vast majority of farmers and ranchers did great work for maintaining and increasing soil health using conservation practices alone, measurement tools will be instrumental in ensuring a sustainable farming future.

To maintain yields and meet the food demands of a growing population while also protecting natural resources required, making additional changes and data tools can help determine what these changes should be.

The end result of gathering data is to analyse it and come up with actionable solutions with better results. For example, a satellite image of a plot of land has several layers of data embedded into a single spectrum giving us a tonne of information to analyse. The geospatial approach and satellite monitoring of farms have led to major advancement in how farmers and companies make their decisions.

Advantages of data analysis in agriculture

Data helps debt-laden farmers, insurance agencies, loan banks, seed companies, machine industry and every big and small player. Data analysis not only creates greater awareness and more accurate knowledge, but it can also plug the lacunae in the supply and marketing chain of the industry.

Information is power, and the industry can now have access to it for more informed decision making. These are the ways in which data analysis can help:

Development of new seed traits - Access to the plant genome with new ways to measure, map and drive information betters products.

Precision farming - Big data takes advantage of information derived through precision farming in aggregate over many farms. The resulting analytics, insights and better decisions can then be deployed through precision farming techniques

Food tracking - Use of sensors and analytics to prevent spoilage and food-borne illnesses

Effect on supply chains - Seismic shifts in the supply chain of seed, crop inputs and food driven by the democratisation of technology and information

The big data revolution is in its early days and most of the potential for value creation is still unclaimed. But it has set the industry on a path of rapid change and new discoveries. Stakeholders committed to innovation will likely be the first to reap rewards. If the farmers would have been concerned about the infirmities in terms of data-based farming, production could be increased.",0
799091,Doha Model shows how to rein in water for irrigation,"In spite of its challenges, digging of streams and creation of pond-like structures along their length can provide farmers with the much needed source of irrigation

Mandla and Dindori districts in southeastern Madhya Pradesh have a highly undulating topography, covered by large tracts of forests. Scheduled Tribes (STs) form more than half of the total population in both the districts, with agriculture as their mainstay.

Mandla and Dindori receive more than 1,200 mm of annual rainfall but, the percentage of the net sown area under irrigation, for both the districts, is among the lowest in Madhya Pradesh.

Mudadih Raiyat, a small village in the Mandla district, has around 56 households, 95 per cent of which belong to the STs as per 2011 Census.

More than half of the village households have their agricultural fields in the vicinity of an ephemeral stream — their only source of irrigation — recharged by the monsoon rainfall.

People use electric pumps to draw water from the stream to cultivate paddy in Kharif season and wheat in Rabi season. However, Jugraj Singh Pandre (35) says that until a year ago, the shallow stream would dry in the middle of the Rabi season — between November and December.

A drying stream would lead to wheat crop failure, and the few open wells in the village do not have the capacity to supplement irrigation.

Improved agriculture through stream digging

During the summer and winter of 2018, as part of a water harvesting programme, several 100-feet-long and 10-feet-deep pond like structures known as ‘Doha Model’ were dug along the length of the village stream. These were dug by deepening the stream and creating earthen bunds between every two such structures.

Farmers claim that these structures have arrested the flow of rainwater in the stream, which would otherwise gush through the undulating terrain. Post-monsoon too, the Doha Model structures tapped into the sub-surface water which would otherwise flow downstream. Thus, water retention in the stream has increased significantly.

Kunnilal Pandre (55), a farmer from Mudadih Raiyat, cultivated coriander in January this year on one of his agricultural plots, which he irrigates using the Doha Model. Another farmer, Shiv Shankar Pandre (32), cultivated wheat over a four-acre land patch which would stay fallow during Rabi until last year.

Close to a dozen households, having their agricultural fields in the vicinity of the stream, feel that they can irrigate their Rabi crops better with the Doha Model. Jugraj adds that the additional stream water is a boon for their cattle in the scorching summer heat.

Fatehpur village in the neighbouring Dindori district, situated on highly undulating terrain and comprising around 100 predominantly ST households, has similar agricultural practices.

At least three fourth of the households have their agriculture lands in the vicinity of a stream, which is the only source of irrigation.

In the summer of 2018, members of the Laxmi women self-help group (SHG), with the help of NGO Action for Social Advancement (ASA), ensured digging of the stream to create Doha Models and prolong the stream water retention. In the same year, post-monsoon, people reported a significant increase in water retention.

Santi Bai (35), a member of the Laxmi SHG, says that because of Doha Models, water in the stream was sufficient to irrigate the wheat crop during Rabi.

Kunwar Singh Tekam (50) recounted digging out certain pockets in the stream for Rabi irrigation, which is not required now. Arjun Mandavi (30) shares that this intervention has benefitted more than half of the agricultural fields in the vicinity of the stream.

Challenges and way ahead

Despite their immediate visible benefits, there are specific challenges to the digging of streams. Pond-like structures on the flowing water streams are prone to continuous silting, particularly on the undulating terrains in Mandla and Dindori, thus making the structures short lived.

Sharad Mishra from ASA, Mandla, said the assumed lifetime for these structures, with no maintenance, is four to five years. To keep the Doha Models functional for long, water-user groups are a potential solution.

In Mudadih Raiyat, multiple water-user groups have been formed, with one group comprising households using water from one Doha Model being solely responsible for its maintenance, including periodic desilting. However, most water user groups are yet to be tested.

Another concern is the long-term, basin level impact of tapping into the sub-surface water flow. A detailed study is required to ascertain what, if any, are its positive or negative implications at the basin level.

In spite of its challenges, digging of streams and creation of pond-like structures along their length can provide farmers with the much needed source of irrigation, especially in high annual rainfall and undulating regions like Mandla and Dindori. Moreover, if, combined with the soil conservation measures upstream, these structures can stay functional for long.",0
1135,AGRIGATE 2022: India�s Largest AgTech Conclave Held in Kolkata,"India�s next big economic opportunity, after winning the world with information technology services, is agriculture, with a current economic value of US$600 billion estimated in 2020-21.

Convergence of agriculture and IT is creating major opportunities to usher in smart-farming technologies and tools, to unlock new economic values for every wing of the agriculture eco-system (Agri Governance, Agri input and Agri output). 

Technology enablement is solving critical age-old problems for the Indian agrarian economy, like production risk coverage, demand supply aggregation of small and marginal farmers, transparent governance, and adding values to the rural economy like market-linked production and addressing the critical challenge of underemployment. Millions of farm-technology jobs in the farm and allied sectors will get created for rural youth.

AgriGate 2022 was hosted by NASSCOM, the premier trade body and chamber of commerce of the Tech industry in India, and InGreens, a Kolkata-born AgTech startup and one of the fastest growing AgTech firms in India.

It is the first such event in India, that�s bringing together all the players in the agriculture and related technology ecosystem, not only from across India but also from six other countries, as well as most of the large Indian Venture Capital firms.

Krishi jagran was the media partner of this event.InGreens is happy to announce several tie-ups with global and Indian partners across AgTech R&D, and business.

An expression of intent with IIT Kharagpur, has been agreed for R&D in satellite image processing, and ready-to-cook food.

fashol.com, of Bangladesh, and InGreens have decided to work together for synergistic growth opportunities.

GreentechAI of UK and InGreens are collaborating for farm data analytics.

InGreens become an industry partner with C-DAC to develop AI-based multimodal dialogue system for Indian farmers

Agriculture policymakers from several Indian states, CEOs from input providers (finance, technology, seeds, fertilizers, farm equipment) to supply chain, food, and retail sector attended the event to connect, collaborate and co-create solutions, to accelerate the digital transformation of this industry, to build the future-of-farms-n-food.

It is interesting to note that agriculture has witnessed the least adoption of IT in the past, and thereby presents a huge scope for a technological leap forward. This is mission-critical if we are to improve farm productivity and efficiency in India, which is one of the world�s leading agriculture economies. With the world�s population expected to grow to 9.7 billion by 2050, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates agriculture will need to produce almost 50 percent more food, livestock fodder, and biofuel than in 2012 to satisfy global demand.",0
796074,"3 Big Things Today, January 20, 2023","1. Wheat Futures Slightly Lower in Overnight Trading

Wheat futures were modestly lower in overnight trading on forecast for some precipitation in the U.S. southern Plains and eastern Midwest where winter wheat is grown.

Snow or a mixed precipitation is forecast for much of Kansas and Oklahoma today, according to the National Weather Service. Storms also are forecast for much of Missouri and Arkansas where soft-red winter varieties are overwintering.

Winter storms will dump snow in much of northeastern Colorado, northwestern Kansas and parts of Nebraska, Commodity Weather Group said in a report.

""(The) southern Plains (will be) slightly wetter next week, chipping away at dryness,"" the forecaster said. Still, at least a quarter of hard-red winter wheat is still seeing drought conditions, CWG said.

Soybeans and corn also were slightly lower in overnight trading as rain is expected in parts of Argentina, where it's been very dry this growing season.

Showers are expected into early Saturday for almost two-thirds of growing areas in the South American country, CWG said.

""Short-term stress narrows from (about) half to a quarter or less (of) Argentina corn and soy ahead of peak late-planted crop needs,"" the forecaster said in its report.

Prices also are lower this morning after a Farm Futures survey showed growers will increase wheat seedings this year by almost 7% year-over-year. Soybean plantings are forecast to rise 1.7% and corn seedings will increase 2.2% from last year, the survey said.

Wheat futures for March delivery fell 3¾ cents to $7.30 3/4 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade, while Kansas City futures lost 5 cents to $8.27 a bushel.

Soybean futures fell 1 cent to $15.13 ¾ a bushel. Soymeal was down $1.60 to $469.60 a short ton, while soy oil gained 0.42 cents to 63.57¢ a pound.

Corn futures for March delivery declined 3¾ cents to $6.73 ½ a bushel.

2. Ethanol Output Surges to Highest in a Month

**

Ethanol production jumped last week to the highest in a month while inventories declined to the lowest level since early December, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.

Output increased to an average of 1.008 million barrels in the seven days that ended on Jan. 13, the EIA said in a report that was delayed due to the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.

That's up from 943,000 barrels a week earlier and the highest since Dec. 16.

In the Midwest, by far the biggest producing region, production rose to an average of 958,000 barrels a day from 895,000 barrels the previous week, the agency said. That was also the highest since Dec. 16.

East Coast output increased to an average of 11,000 barrels a day, up from 10,000 barrels a week earlier. Gulf Coast production was up to 24,000 barrels per day from 22,000 barrels the previous week, the EIA said.

That was the entirety of the gains as Rocky Mountain production was steady at 12,000 barrels per day, on average, and West Coast output was unchanged week-to-week at 4,000 barrels per day, the government said.

Ethanol stockpiles, meanwhile, fell to 23.402 million barrels in the week through Jan. 13. That's down from 23.8 million barrels the previous week and the lowest level since Dec. 2, the EIA said in its report.

Cotton farmers will not be able to recover the production costs if the losses are high. Photo: iStock.

In addition to the heavy losses incurred by excess rainfall during monsoon months, farmers in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra are now forced to sell cotton at low price, eventually pushing them towards debt.

Over 3.2 million hectares of agricultural land, as well as more than 4.8 million farmers, have been affected by excess rainfall between June and October last year, the peak monsoon months, according to data from the Aurangabad divisional commissionerate.

Also read: Extreme rainfall damages nearly 4 million hectares of crops in Marathwada

The production was affected by excess and erratic rainfall. In some areas, snails also caused damage to crops. There is no individual crop data to assess the damage to cotton.

Kishor Tawar, a farmer owning seven acres of land in Paithan taluka of Aurangabad district, told Down to Earth:

Excess rainfall has caused a loss of about 50 per cent across the cotton belt region. I had grown cotton on four acres of irrigated land and managed to produce only 16 quintals against an expectation of 28 quintals.

The losses are incredibly high and the selling prices have dropped recently, impacting even the recovery of production costs in some cases, Tawar said.

“On an average a farmer has suffered a loss between two-five quintals per acre depending on land, soil and the amount of rainfall received,” he said.

Farmers will not be able to recover the production costs if the losses are high, he added.

The prices dropped from Rs 9,000 per quintal to Rs 6,000-Rs 6,500 per quintal this year, Tawar, who is also an activist with farmers’ body Shetkari Sanghatna.

“Earlier, the companies that procure cotton said the produce will elicit high demand and fetch good price, but the erratic weather has taken it all away,” he said.

Parmeshwar Gholap, a farmer with seven acres of land in Pachegaon of Beed district, said he produced 28 quintals of cotton, costing him Rs 1.30 lakh.

“The cost of chemical fertilisers and pesticides increased this year and the changing weather demanded more pest control measures,” he said.

Gholap said even if he fetches Rs 7,000 for a quintal, he will not even earn Rs 2 lakh. “I know the buyers will not buy at that price. How will I feed my family with Rs 40,000-50,000 for a year?” he asked.

The situation worsens every year. “Due to the same, farmers now think that the previous year was better than the current. The low price is demotivating the farmers,” Gholap said.

Rameshwar Gade, another farmer from the same village, said the central government’s interference is also to be blamed for the low cotton price.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India suspended cotton futures trading in the stock market in December. The suspension is for a year and it stopped potential investors from participating in cotton trading, which would have supported an increase in the production, he said.

The move would only benefit large textile companies, who can afford to buy cotton from farmers in bulk at a low cost, Gade said.

“Moreover, the cost of cotton per quintal ranges from Rs 9,000-Rs 12,000 in Maharashtra and neighbouring states like Telangana.

The rates are higher than international market by five per cent-10 per cent. In such a situation, the cotton export cost will have to be further reduced to encourage international buyers to procure from Indian farmers,” he added.

The overall situation is only worsening the state of cotton farmers, Gade said.

796084,Brazil soybean harvest slowed by recent rains,"Much anticipated rainfall returned to portions of Argentina in the fourth week of January, week-ending Jan. 28. However, not all areas received beneficial rainfall. Areas northwest of Buenos Aires saw the most substantial rainfall. In fact, this was one of the wettest final weeks of January in 30+ years for the Salta province, according to data from WeatherTrends360. More rainfall will be needed to reverse the current drought trends as Argentina struggles with one of the worst droughts in decades.

Areas closer to southern Brazil saw lighter or no rainfall, and those trends bled over into southern Brazil. For Rio Grande do Sul, this was the sixth driest and the first hottest fourth week of January in 30+ years. The hot and dry conditions in southern Brazil are likely to put crop yields into jeopardy.

Meanwhile, plentiful rainfall continued to be the trend in central Brazil. In Mato Grosso, this was the ninth wettest fourth week of January in 30+ years. While the rainfall this season has been beneficial for crops, as the soybean harvest picks up steam, a break in the wet weather would help to speed along the soybean harvest and subsequent planting of the second corn crop.

As January 2023 comes to an end and February begins, there will be more chances of rainfall in Argentina. According to forecasts from WeatherTrends360, the week-ending Feb. 4 will be the 11th wettest in 30+ years for Argentina’s major soybean-growing regions. Again, rainfall could be hit-or-miss with the highest amounts located northwest of Buenos Aires.

Even southern Brazil has a chance at seeing an increase in rainfall with precipitation trending closer to, if not above, normal for the start of February 2023. Mato Grosso looks to see some breaks in the rain with rainfall trending closer to, if not below, normal which should help with the soybean harvest. Temperatures shouldn’t be a huge issue this week, except for some heat in Rio Grande do Sul to start the week.

796085,"3 Big Things Today, January 30, 2023","1. Soybean and Grain Futures Rise Overnight

Soybeans and grains were higher in overnight trading as producers in Argentina evaluate crop damage from months of dry weather.

The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange said in a statement released last week that while rains slowed deterioration of the crops, soybeans and corn still have a long way to go until harvest.

Soybean planting was all but finished at the end of last week, with the highest accumulated precipitation amounts reported in the states of Cordoba, La Pampa, and Buenos Aires. Corn sowing also was nearly finished.

Still, the exchange said, losses in early planted crops and due to high temperatures and lack of moisture in November, December, and January negatively affected soils and crops.

Farmers took advantage of the recent rains to extend an planting additions but that amount accounts for only a small percentage of total plantings, the report said.

Demand for U.S. agricultural products also has been strong in recent days, underpinning prices.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported large sales of corn and soybeans to overseas buyers for six straight business days through Thursday.

Weekly sales of corn rose 20% in the week through Jan. 19, soybeans sales gained 16%, and wheat sales were up 6%, USDA said in a report on Thursday.

Soybean futures rose 18¼ cents to $15.27 ¾ a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soymeal was up $6.80 to $480.30 a short ton, while soy oil gained 0.96 cents to 61.58 cents a pound.

Corn futures for March delivery rose 3¼ cents to $6.86 ¼ a bushel.

Wheat futures for March delivery were up 5¾ cents to $7.56 while Kansas City futures added 9½ cents to $8.78 ¾ a bushel.

Investors raised their net-long positions, or bets on higher prices, in corn to the highest level in more than three months while lowering bullish bets on beans, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Net-longs in corn rose to 203,506 futures contracts in the seven days that ended on Jan. 24, the CFTC said in a report. That's up from 198,865 contracts a week earlier and the largest such position since Nov. 8.

Speculators went the other way in beans, reducing their net-longs to 147,638 contracts last week, down from 168,380 contracts the previous week, the agency said.

In wheat, investors increased their net-long positions, or bets on lower prices, in soft-red winter futures to 73,802 contracts last week. That's an increase from 64,641 contracts the previous week and the largest bearish position since May 2019, according to the government.

Hedge funds and other large investment firms slightly reduced their net-short position in hard-red winter wheat to 7,826 futures contracts compared with 7,826 contracts the previous week, the CFTC said in its report.

The weekly Commitment of Traders report from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission shows trader positions in futures markets.

The report provides positions held by commercial traders, or those using futures to hedge their physical assets; noncommercial traders, or money managers (also called large speculators); and nonreportables, or small speculators.

A net-long position indicates more traders are betting on higher prices, while a net-short position means more are betting futures will decline.

We are in the home stretch. We were deathly dry and cold up until late April, then we received two good rains. We are extremely blessed to get what we did, but it made for a later start. For the last two-plus weeks, we've been running flat-out planting, spraying, and seeding.

It’s been a super hard push and luckily, we are getting close to the end of planting corn and seeding soybeans. We're hoping to beat the rain this weekend. We have also needed to run more planes this year to get our wheat sprayed due to having too many windy days and the rain from earlier this month. To stay on track, we decided to hit our first pass on winter wheat from the air.
