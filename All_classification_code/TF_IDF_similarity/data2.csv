'Need To Work At Micro Level'
According to NDTV, Vinayak Hegana, who runs a counselling centre for agricultural producers in partnership with the district administration in Osmanabad, underlined the need to work at the micro level while analysing farmer suicides.

Danve also brought up the issues of expensive fertilisers and seedlings of poor quality and claimed that these are detrimental to the agricultural industry. He noted that the most crucial factor is that these farm resources meet acceptable quality standards.",1

Pune: Farmer commits suicide due to harrasment by money lender In Bhor Taluka
Due to moneylender pressure, a farmer committed suicide by hanging himself in Kurungwadi village in Bhor taluka. An illegal moneylender has been charged with inciting the farmer's suicide.

Satish Bajirao Shilimkar (43), a resident of Kurungwadi, taluka Bhor, district Pune, is the name of the deceased farmer. Amrut Mahadev Shilimkar, a resident of Tambhad, taluka Bhor, district Pune, has been charged with inciting Shilimkar to commit suicide and illegal money lending.

82,Onion suicides,"I have in my head a story scenario—dystopian, fictional—where poor Filipino onion farmers who are heavily in debt rise up in revolt because of the neglect and shabby treatment they get from government officials who choose to hobnob with the world’s wealthiest and wallow in food porn, instead of addressing problems of starvation on the ground. I have it all written out in my mind, except for the details on how it would end—perhaps a bloody denouement for the protagonists and the antagonists that would spark a national revolt worthy of world attention. Think Basi Revolt of 1807 or something like that, but with media coverage.

But before I could finish the story in my cinematic imagination, here comes this newspaper’s headline story where cases of suicide by distressed onion farmers are cited, because of their desperation over their debts, loss of joy and purpose in life, the dark scenario ahead, the burden that is too heavy to bear.

I assume that the farmers’ despair and hopelessness are unlike those of the differently situated suicidals who are also experiencing extreme emotional pain and hopelessness—results of many factors—that are nevertheless just as legit. In comparison, farmers who till the soil are a hardy breed physically and emotionally, or so we think.

Many of our farmers are still into so-called subsistence agriculture for their own survival, lucky if they have surplus to sell. But I think of them as so much better situated than those who had moved to the cities and live under bridges and beside garbage-filled creeks. Alas, farmers who stay and endeavor to produce cash crops later realize that the big world out there is one sinister, dog-eat-dog world where predators hold sway.

Whenever farmers raise an outcry (as in the case of the rice tariffication law that was detrimental to them), I think of French artist Jean-François Millet’s painting that inspired American poet Edwin Markham’s “The Man with the Hoe” that we had to memorize and recite in class. It is an ekphrasis or poem that describes a piece of art, a protest poem that deals with social injustice.

Straight from memory, here goes: “Down by the centuries he leans/ Upon his hoe and gazes on the ground,/ The emptiness of ages in his face,/ And on his back the burden of the world./ Who made him dead to rapture and despair,/ A thing that grieves not and that never hopes,/ Stolid and stunned, a brother to the ox?”

Google the entire poem and the painting which is not, by any standard, Amorsolo-esque.

Last Tuesdays’ banner story (“Losses driving onion farmers to desperation,” by Melvin Gascon, Jordeene B. Lagare, and Marlon Ramos) said: “Merlita Gallardo of Bayambang, Pangasinan, the widow of an onion farmer who killed himself in January 2021, recounted to the Senate committee hearing on agriculture how their sustained losses beginning with the pandemic year worsened their anxieties.

“‘He went far away from the farm to kill himself. Because our debts were piling up, and he didn’t want to borrow [money] anymore.’” Her husband, Roger, was 49.

“Elvin Jerome Laceda, president of nongovernmental organization Young Farmers’ Challenge Club of the Philippines, said his group has learned about four other farmers in Bayambang who were also driven to suicide because of debt.”

That, while the President of this republic and himself as (his self-appointed) secretary of agriculture and his coterie of 70 or so (as reported) how-do-you-call-them are in snowy Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. While airline personnel who bring home a few kilos of onions as tacky pasalubong are threatened with smuggling charges, and the big-time onion smugglers are smug and happy.

From Leonardo Montemayor, chair of the Federation of Free Farmers: “If there had to be importation, it could have been done earlier. It should not coincide with the harvest period. It is painful for farmers who toiled in the face of typhoons, pests, high prices of fertilizers and pesticides, and then at harvest time, when they expect to recoup their expenses, imported onions would arrive.” (A translation from Tagalog.)

In some parts of the world, India among them, the farming sector has some of the highest number of suicides. Even the US farming sector has a noticeable high rate of suicide.

In this country, farming as a livelihood—not as a hobby or pastime—could drain the life out of those who till the land, an irony because it is the farming sector that nourishes us to life. How is it that the life-giving land has become a curse, a graveyard for their dreams?",1
91,"‘Release Rs 14,000-crore in food subsidy’ in Odisha","BHUBANESWAR: A delegation of MPs of the ruling BJD on Monday met Union food and distribution minister Piyush Goyal and requested him to release pending food subsidy of Rs 14,292 crore to Odisha.

95,MHI to investigate EV makers for alleged pricing violation under FAME II subsidies,"Ministry of Heavy Industries (MHI) is tightening noose around the top EV makers in the country following alleged defalcation of the FAME II subsidy. The electric vehicle manufacturers have been asked for an explanation of how the maximum ex-factory price cap is being violated.
Previously in 2022, some of the leading EV makers such as Hero Electric as well as Okinawa were also sent notice to put forward documents supporting their subsidy claims and subsidies on these firms were put on hold for some time.
In past, the government has also launched a probe involving import of components by ev companies over allegations of wrongly claimed subsidies under a scheme that promotes manufacturing of EV in the Indian market.Moreover, previous reports also indicate that the Centre is also looking into the matter in a bid to recover the wrongly claimed subsidies via legal options.
With an outlay of Rs 10,000-crore, the FAME subsidy has been aimed to accelerate the use of electric vehicles in the country. The manufacturers of electric vehicles can provide a discount of up to 40% on the overall cost of locally produced battery-powered vehicles and claim it as a subsidy from the Indian government. Thanks to this, the EV makers have been able to retail the vehicles at an affordable cost.
The first leg of the FAME scheme (FAME-I) was introduced in the country back in 2015, and was extended till March 31st, 2019. Following this, the second phase of the programme, or FAME-II was launched the following month, April 1, 2019 and is extended up to March 31, 2024, from the early enclosure of March 31, 2022.",1

104,"Thousands of farmers gather in Delhi for 'mahapanchayat', cause huge traffic snarls","New Delhi: Thousands of farmers from various states gathered at the Jantar Mantar here on Monday to take part in a ""mahapanchayat"" called by a farmers' body, causing massive traffic snarls in Delhi, especially at the city's borders, including Singhu and Ghazipur.

As the farmers associated with different unions reached Delhi, police put up layers of barricades at all the entry points of the city and checked every vehicle entering the national capital, which led to huge traffic jams.

Apart from the borders, including Ghazipur, Singhu and Tikri, key stretches on the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, the Palam flyover, Aurobindo Marg, Ring Road (near Indraprastha Park), the Ghaziabad-Wazirabad road and the Munirka road, among other roads, witnessed traffic snarls.

Other than Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, farmers from states such as Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha and Kerala arrived in Delhi to take part in the ""mahapanchayat"" that was called demanding a legislation on the minimum support price (MSP) for crops, farm loan waiver and on other issues.

Many of them came with their bags packed and with an intent to stay put. Holding flags and wearing caps given by farmer leaders, they were seen sitting in and around Janpath.

They raised slogans for farmer unity and against the Centre for ""not fulfilling"" its promises.

Magha Nibori, a farmer from Punjab with one acre of farmland on which he cultivates seasonal crops, said he came here fully prepared to stay put, if required.

""We are poor farmers. Nobody is helping us. Nothing is being done for us. We participated in last year's (anti-farm laws) protests as well. The government had assured us that it will listen to our demands but nothing is being done. We will not hesitate to camp here, if required, to get our demands addressed,"" Nibori told PTI.

The heavy security measures led to massive traffic snarls across the city. Police also put up cemented barricades to avoid any untoward incident.

The traffic police informed the commuters about the traffic situation and advised them to plan their journeys accordingly.

""In view of a heightened security scenario and threat perception, some persons or protestors were stopped at the Ghazipur border. However, after due verifications, all of them were allowed to proceed to their respective destinations,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Priyanka Kashyap said.

In a tweet, police asked motorists to avoid Tolstoy Marg, Sansad Marg, Janpath Road, Ashoka Road, Connaught Place Outer Circle, Baba Kharak Singh Marg and Pandit Pant Marg due to the farmers' congregation.

SKM (non-political) leaders claimed that at some locations, farmers were being stopped from reaching Jantar Mantar. However, the Delhi Police denied the claim.

""This is a daylong peaceful event where we will reiterate our demands such as a legal guarantee on the MSP and the cancellation of the Electricity (Amendment) Bill, 2022 among others,"" said Abhimanyu Singh Kohar, an SKM (non-political) member and one of the organisers of the ""mahapanchayat"".

He, however, added that police are yet to give permission for the ""mahapanchayat"" at the Jantar Mantar.

The SKM (non-political) is a breakaway group of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) that had spearheaded the year-long protests at Delhi's borders against three contentious farm laws of the Centre.

Kohar said farmers coming from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were stopped on Sunday night and not allowed to reach the Jantar Mantar. They were taken to Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, Rakabganj and Moti Bagh and released later, he said.

Kohar said during the anti-farm laws protests, the Centre had promised to consider all the demands of the farmers but did nothing.

""So here we are again to raise our demands and chalk out the future strategy of the movement,"" he added.

In November 2020, thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh had camped at Delhi's border points in protest against the three farm laws, which were repealed a year later.

The farmers had suspended their movement in December last year after the Centre assured them to consider their other demands concerning a legal guarantee on the MSP and withdrawal of cases against them, among others.

Mahendra Singh from Punjab, who had to undergo partial hand and finger amputation due to an accident a few years ago, said he has not received his pension for several months.

""I have come here from Gidder Pani in Punjab. My pension has not been credited for months and no official has any answer. The Centre is also not fulfilling our demands related to the MSP and other issues. I have come here to ask for my rights,"" he said.

Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait was detained by the Delhi Police at the Ghazipur border on Sunday while he was trying to enter the capital to take part in a protest against unemployment at the Jantar Mantar.

Tikait had alleged that the Delhi Police was working at the behest of the BJP-led Centre and did not allow him to meet the unemployed youngsters.",1
105,"Lumpy skin disease: Union minister Rupala assures help to Punjab, Haryana","Union Minister Parshottam Rupala Tuesday reviewed the vaccination of cattle in Punjab and Haryana in the wake of lumpy skin disease affecting a large number of animals and assured help from the Centre.

Rupala, the Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, held meetings with Punjab Animal Husbandry Minister Laljit Singh Bhullar and Haryana’s Animal Husbandry Minister J P Dalal here to review the situation in the two neighbouring states including availability of vaccine and arrangements being made by the state governments for prevention of the disease.

He later said he assured the two states of the Centre’s total help for the eradication of the disease and also encouraged them to carry out a larger number of vaccinations.

Punjab minister Bhullar raised the demand for arranging goat pox vaccine in adequate quantity for more than 25 lakh livestock. He said the Punjab government has administered 2.05 lakh doses of vaccine to cattle till Monday evening. The affected animals are being monitored and adequate medication and other precautions are being ensured as per the Government of India guidelines.Bhullar said he had visited various districts of Punjab to get first-hand information about the problems of milk producers. Fazilka, Sri Muktsar Sahib, Faridkot, Ferozepur, Bathinda, Tarn Taran, Jalandhar and Amritsar are the most affected districts, he said.

The Punjab minister pointed out that there is a huge difference in prices of different vaccines. “Hence, the uniformity in the price and availability of doses in sufficient quantities should be ensured,” he said.

To this, Rupala assured that prices of vaccines will be rationalised and the supply in the required quantity to the state will be ensured, according to an official release of the Punjab government.

The Union minister said Haryana minister Dalal informed him that so far eight districts in the state are free from this disease as not even a single case has been reported there.

Rupala directed the states to follow the guidelines issued by the central government to deal with the disease through vaccination drive. He directed that vaccination should be done first in the districts where there are animals suffering from the disease so that its spread to other districts can be stopped.

He also directed the officials concerned from the two states to prepare isolation wards for affected animals to prevent the disease from spreading further.

Rupala later told reporters that both the state governments at their level are working at the ground level to check spread of the disease in animals. He said guidelines have been given how to bury animals after they die of the disease.

J P Dalal said so far 14 districts of Haryana are affected and 87 cows have died due to the disease so far, he said.

He said 3 lakh doses of goat pox vaccine had earlier been ordered by Haryana. “We will need 18-20 lakh more doses,” Dalal told reporters after the meeting.

Dalal said ICAR-National Research Centre on Equines (ICAR-NRCE), Hisar (Haryana), in collaboration with ICAR-Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI), Izatnagar, Uttar Pradesh, has developed a homologous live-attenuated LSD vaccine “Lumpi-ProVacInd”.

“We have urged the Centre that the approval for this vaccine should be fast-tracked and told them that this can be manufactured at ICAR-NRCE, Hisar. The Union minister said that the entire process and protocols that need to be followed may take 2-3 months,” said Dalal.

Vikas Pratap, Principal Secretary, Animal Husbandry, Punjab, said as many as 74,325 animals have been suspected to be affected by this disease in the state. Of these, 39,248 are cured till date in the state, he said.

Punjab has so far received 3.16 lakh doses of vaccine, said the principal secretary.

Earlier in the day, former Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal said the Punjab government should give the dairy farmers compensation of at least Rs 50,000 for each animal that died due to lumpy skin disease.

The SAD MP from Bathinda also urged Rupala to send central teams to Punjab for effective monitoring and vaccination of animals. She accused the AAP government in Punjab of not doing the needful as hundreds of animals have died while thousands of cattle have been affected by this disease.",1
106,Farmers should keep fighting till they get remunerative prices: KCR in Chandigarh,"Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao on Sunday reached out to farmers in Punjab and Haryana, saying they can change government if they want and should keep fighting till they get a constitutional guarantee for remunerative prices of their crops.

The Telangana chief minister also paid tributes to the farmers who died during the course of the agitation against the Centre's now-repealed farm laws and said he bows to their grit and determination.""If farmers want, they can change government. It is not a big thing. From where the power comes, it comes from us. The agitation should continue till farmers get the right price and there is a constitutional guarantee for it,"" he said.

He urged farmers that their next agitation should be throughout the country.

""Farmers from north, south, east and west should fight together,"" said the chief minister, who is visiting multiple states apparently eyeing a role in the national politics.

He met Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday and had a lunch with Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday. Rao, also called KCR, is scheduled to visit Bihar and West Bengal in coming days.

In Chandigarh, he was accompanied on the dais by Kejriwal, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and farmer leader Rakesh Tikait.

Without naming the BJP-led Centre, Rao said it does not like it if any state or a chief minister does something for farmers as he addressed the kin of those who died during the stir against the farm laws.

Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann's announcement of giving minimum support price on moong was also not liked by them, he said.

""We give food to the country after toiling hard in the fields. There should be justice with us. There should not be such a painful situation,"" he added.

""If any state or CM does anything for farmers' welfare, they do not like it. They put pressure on you,"" Rao said.

Referring to the stir against the central laws, he said farmers were called Khalistani and traitors.

""Eyes well up. It is painful. Why is our country such? There is a need to worry about it,"" he said.

Rao said there are many problems for which people have to struggle, die and sacrifice their lives.

""Problems are there in every country. The kind of problems we have, it does not exist anywhere,"" he said.

Rao said before the formation of Telangana state, the situation of the farming community was pitiable.

""Every day, 10-20 farmers used to commit suicide and there was also power shortage. Nobody was there to hear the farmers out,"" said Rao.

He said after the formation of Telangana as a state, the power situation was set right and round the clock electricity was given to every sector.

""Why I am saying this today is because the government which is sitting in Delhi is asking for installation of meters, measuring their consumption and taking charges,"" the Telangana chief minister said.

""We had said in our assembly we will not let the meters installed even if we have to die for it. They can do anything,"" he said apparently referring to the Centre.

Rao also lauded the contribution of Punjab to the freedom struggle and bringing green revolution in the farming sector. ""Indian history can never forget it. Punjab brought green revolution and fed the country. it can never be forgotten,"" he said.

Rao distributed cheques for Rs 3 lakh as financial assistance to the kin of the farmers, who died during the stir against the farm laws.

Over 700 farmers had died during the course of the agitation at the Delhi borders due to various reasons, including harsh winter, road accidents, cardiac arrest and ailments.

Rao also gave Rs 10 lakh compensation each to families of four Punjab soldiers who died in a violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops at Galwan Valley in Ladakh in 2020.",1
107,"Punjab farmers sit on protest near Chandigarh-Mohali border, CM terms it 'unwarranted'","A farmer leader said they do not want any confrontation with the state government, but they will have to break the barriers and move towards Chandigarh if their issues were not resolved.Punjab farmers sat on a protest near the Chandigarh-Mohali border on Tuesday after being stopped from heading to the state capital to press the AAP government with various demands, including a bonus on wheat and beginning paddy sowing from June 10.

Terming the protest ""unwarranted and undesirable"" Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann asked the farmer unions to stop sloganeering and join hands with the state government to stop Punjab's depleting water table.

Mann said his doors are open for the farmers to hold talks but ""hollow slogans"" cannot break his resolve to check further depletion of the water table.

He also said that he is a farmer's son and is well aware of the issues afflicting crop growers.

Earlier, farmer leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal gave an ultimatum to the Punjab government, saying if the chief minister does not hold a meeting with the protesters by Wednesday, they will move towards Chandigarh breaking barricades for holding an indefinite protest.

A heavy contingent of police was deployed at the Chandigarh-Mohali border in the wake of several farmer bodies' call for an indefinite protest in the Union Territory over their demands.

The Mohali police put up barricades and tippers and rolled out water cannons to prevent protesting farmers from entering Chandigarh.

The Chandigarh police too made similar security arrangements.

""It is the start of our struggle in Punjab and it will continue till our demands are met. Only 25 per cent of farmers have come here so far. More will come tomorrow. It is a do or die battle,"" said a farmer leader.

Several farmer unions had given a call for an indefinite protest in Chandigarh on the lines of the year-long agitation at the Delhi borders against the Centre's three farm laws which were repealed in response to the protests.

The call was given by the farmer bodies several days ago.

Among their various demands, farmers want a Rs 500 bonus on each quintal of wheat as their yield has dropped and shrivelled because of unprecedented heatwave conditions.

They are also against the Punjab government's decision to allow paddy sowing in a staggered manner from June 18 to lessen the electricity burden and conserve underground water.

The protesters want the government to allow them to sow paddy from June 10.

They also want a notification issued for the minimum support price for maize and moong.

They are also demanding the government lower the charges on the extension of electricity load from Rs 4,800 to Rs 1,200, 10-12 hours of power supply and release of outstanding sugarcane payment.

The protesters are also against the installation of smart electricity meters.

Carrying ration, beds, fans, coolers, utensils, cooking gas cylinders and other items, farmers from across Punjab assembled at Gurdwara Amb Sahib in Mohali.

The protesting farmers said they had got a message from the Punjab government for a meeting.

""We got a message from the Union Territory DGP that a meeting with Chief Minister Mann has been fixed on Wednesday at 11 am. Then another message came, saying as the CM has gone to Delhi and the meeting can be held with the chief secretary,"" Dallewal told reporters on Tuesday evening.

He said the protesters were not hopeful of getting their issues redressed by meeting a government official.

""It is our warning that if Chief Minister Mann does not hold a meeting with us and resolve our issues by tomorrow, we will be compelled to move ahead further,"" Dallewal said.

The chief minister, however, said the protesting farmers can come anytime for the meeting but sought their support for his government's efforts in protecting the environment.

""Talks are always open. They (farmers) have a democratic right for holding a 'dharna' but they should spell out their issues,"" Mann told reporters after returning from Delhi.

About the protesting farmers being adamant about meeting him only, the chief minister asked whether ""raising 'murdabad' slogans is the way to holding a meeting"".

He said the MSP on moong and basmati crops would be given to the farmers.

Seeking their support for a year, Mann said if the farmers suffer any loss during this period they will be fully compensated by the state government.

About the date of starting the paddy-sowing season, he said, ""I am the son of a farmer. I know how it can happen. What is the difference between June 18 and 10.""

Earlier in the day, the protesters began their march from Gurdwara Amb Sahib and broke the first layer of barricades as they moved towards the other barriers put up by the Mohali Police near the Chandigarh-Mohali border.

But Dallewal urged the protesters not to break the second layer of barricades and instead sat on a protest there peacefully.

""Moving ahead (by breaking barricades) is not a big thing for you. But we will sit here in a peaceful manner,"" Dallewal said.

""We will hold a protest here. It is like the agitation in Delhi.""

Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal) General Secretary Harinder Singh Lakhowal said, ""We will win this protest.""

He said that during their last meeting with the chief minister on April 17, they had submitted a charter of 11 demands and Mann had assured them of resolving their issues.

But not a single demand has been accepted yet, Lakhowal claimed.

After being stopped by the Mohali Police, farmers squatted there while parking their vehicles in the middle of the road.

Some of them even started to make tea there.

The police had to divert traffic on the Chandigarh-Mohali road near the YPS Chowk to alternative routes.

AAP's Punjab unit chief spokesperson Malvinder Singh Kang said the state government is committed to the welfare of farmers and it will address their genuine demands.

""If the farmer bodies want to hold a dialogue for the farming sector, the doors of the state government are always open,"" Kang said.",1

Chairing a high-level review meeting, chief minister Yogi Adityanath said that with the spirit of the Indian culture of nature conservation, there is a need to take forward the tree plantation campaign as a mass movement.According to the state of forest report 2021, 9.23% of the total geographical area of Uttar Pradesh has
forest cover. In 2013 it was 8.82%. There has been an increase of 91 square kilometres in the total forest
cover and tree cover during 2019. The government has now set a target of further enhancing this area
to 15% by 2030.
Indigenous plants like Banyan, Peepal, Pakad, Neem, Bael, Amla, Mango, Jackfruit, and Drumstick will
get preference during the plantation drive. The nodal agency for plantation is the forest department.
But apart from the forest department, 26 other departments will participate in the grand campaign of
the plantation.
The target of each department is already set. In this respect, the highest target of 12.60 crores and
12.32 crore is for the forest and rural development departments respectively. Apart from this, the
target of the agriculture department and horticulture department is 2.35 crore and 1.55",1
112,"Price of fish soars due to rise in fuel prices, less supply","Mangaluru: With the fish catch dropping due to an increase in temperature at sea, coupled by a rise in diesel price, the supply of fresh fish landing at the Old Port had reduced drastically, leading to 20% to 30% rise in prices of commonly available fish as well as premium fish.
The drop in catch and diesel price hike has been a deterrent for boats venturing into the sea, though the monsoon fishing ban is just a month away. If on an average, 50 boats used to land at the Old Port during this season last year, the count is barely 10, since the last fortnight.
Adding to this, with only a few varieties of fish being available in the market, and the availability of premium fish in the market coming down, the prices are seeing a steep increase.
KFDC sources said that only disco fish (big eye snapper), brown prawns and mackerel are landing in sufficient quantities, whereas the quantity of premium fish like seer and white pomfret are just two boat loads, as against 10-15 during this season last year. Black pomfret have become very rare, with their catch landing in the market only twice or thrice a week, again leading to an increase in price.
There’s no silver fish (anchovy), koddai (coaker) and ade (false trevally), nang (large tooth flounder) available, and what arrives here is from Chennai.
With sardines also becoming rare, their price, when available, almost matches with mackerel, which retails around Rs 200/kg. The price of seer fish and white pomfret is about Rs 900 to Rs 1,000/kg at the landing centres itself. Kaane (lady fish) though available, is also on the pricier side, at Rs 900/kg.
“Only if there’s news of good catch, it’ll spur some more boats to venture into the sea. The owners spend around Rs 1 lakh per trip, and without a good catch becomes unprofitable,’’ said a source.
Perhaps, this is for the first time in many years, the catch of fish has become so less, even though fish migrate for breeding during the pre-monsoon month, said the source, adding that this will continue till fishermen locate good schools of fish. Most fishermen have said that they are abstaining from fishing, as the catch is less, and with the escalated fuel price, it is wiser not to go fishing, as they are not assured of breaking even.Fresh fish rates (per kg)
Sardine: Rs 180
Mackerel: Rs 200

Low wind speeds, lower atmospheric temperatures, higher rainfall and lower sea surface temperatures are cited as possible environmental signs.
It is almost August, and probably, the time for heavy rains and blooms along the beaches in Chennai.

Adequate nutrients brought in by ample rainfall and high abundance of plankton, called diatom Thalassiosira sp. bloom trigger (bioluminescent) noctiluca scintillonsAccording to a study conducted by the National Center for Coastal Research (NCCR).

Plankton is available in the ocean and due to the available nutrition, it will multiply and bloom. The report cited low wind speeds, lower atmospheric temperatures, higher rainfall and lower sea surface temperatures as possible environmental signs, the report said.

Local hydrodynamics and diverging currents modulate the appearance and dispersal of a sudden outbreak of bioluminescent dinoflagellate noctiluca scintillons bloom in the field.

The paper, which was authored by Pravakar Mishra, Mahmuda Begum, Anita Gera and others and recently published in the scientific journal oceanographyThe blooming event focuses on a 16-km stretch after heavy rains in August 2019.

During this period, when the team took physical samples from beaches including Marina, Elliots, Panayurkuppam, and Kovalam, wind speeds were 5 m/s low, temperatures dropped, a day high rainfall was recorded, and the sea surface The temperature was low. ,

The paper explained that once the bloom subsides, there is an increase in the bacterial population associated with the phyto-plankton bloom. The lowest count was recorded at Panayurkuppam beach and the highest at Elliot’s beach. Total coliform was also recorded in waves.

Bioluminescence observed due to turbulence and rapid wave break in the surf zone, which stimulates bioluminescence noctiluca scintillons cells. Within two days after bioluminescence appeared, bloom cells gradually degenerated and moved away from the stream, and finally declined.",1

The food ministry has allowed 60 lakh tonnes of sugar exports for the current 2022-23 marketing year (October-September), which is expected to see a drop in the sugar production. India exported a record 110 lakh tonnes of sugar in the previous year.

""We have not yet taken a call. we are closely monitoring the production and we would take a call may be in March depending on what the final figures of anticipated production are,"" Chopra told reporters here when asked whether the government will hike the sugar export quota.

He said the sugar production is estimated to be lower in the 2022-23 marketing year because of bad weather in some producing states.

Recently, Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said that sugar production is estimated to fall 5 per cent in the current marketing year to 340 lakh tonnes as more quantity of sugarcane juice is being diverted for the production of ethanol.

Sugar production stood at 358 lakh tonnes in the 2021-22 marketing year.

There will be an estimated diversion of 45 lakh tonnes of sweetener towards ethanol manufacturing. Sugarcane juice/syrup and B-molasses are being diverted to ethanol making.

202,Wheat production estimated to touch new record of 112.18 million tonnes in 2022-23 crop year: Govt,"The country's wheat production is expected to touch a new record of 112.18 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year (July-June), according to the agriculture ministry's latest estimate. Wheat production had declined marginally to 107.74 million tonnes in the previous year due to heat wave in some states.

The previous record in wheat production was 109.59 million tonnes in 2020-21 crop year.

Wheat is a major rabi crop.

As per the second estimate of foodgrains production released by the agriculture ministry, wheat production is estimated to be 112.18 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year, higher by 4.40 million tonnes from the previous year.

Total area planted with wheat crop has risen by only 1.39 lakh hectares to 343.23 lakh hectares (ha) in the rabi season of the 2022-23 crop year (July-June) from the year-ago period, but the crop yields are expected to be better due to good weather conditions.

Wheat has already started arriving in Madhya Pradesh, one of the major wheat growing states in the country.

Total foodgrain production is also estimated to touch a record of 323.55 million tonnes in the 2022-23 crop year, higher by 7.93 million tonnes from the previous year.",0
203,"Drone use not limited to pesticide spraying; tremendous scope in organic, natural farming too: Govt","Union minister of civil aviation on Tuesday said the applicability of drone in the agriculture sector is beyond pesticide spraying and has tremendous scope in organic and natural farming as well. Drone industry in India has grown 6-8 times in the last one-and-a-half years. The drone infrastructure set up in the country is ""extremely robust"" and an Indian case study of drones as pioneer in agriculture will be exhibited in the ongoing meeting of G20 agriculture working group.

India's aim is to become a global hub for drones by 2030, for which an industry friendly policy including the Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) is in place, he added.

Addressing the media on the sidelines of the first G-20 Agriculture Deputies Meeting here, the Union minister said: ""Don't look at drones through narrow lines. The versatility and diversity of the application of using drones as service is vast.""

The use of drones in agriculture should not be limited to pesticide spraying. It can be used in cadastral mapping and survey of agriculture land, he said.

""The area of drone application for jaivik kheti (organic farming) is also tremendous. ...Even in natural farming, there is tremendous scope for application of drones,"" Scindia noted.

As organic farming sees an organic growth, there will surely be the movement of drone application, he added.

The government is promoting organic and natural farming in a big way to reduce use of chemical fertilisers and save mother earth. Madhya Pradesh is currently leading in organic farming.

Currently, drones in agriculture are permitted only for pesticides spraying.

Asserting that many more applications will continue to emerge in future, the Union minister said there are multiple uses of drones. ""I think as volumes grow, versatility will also grow.""

He mentioned that the prime minister has been clear in determination that India can no longer be a follower and the country must be a leader in unexplored areas in the world. Drone is one such area.

For achieving the aim of becoming a global hub for drones by 2030, the government has adopted a three-pronged approach, he said.

Firstly, the government has put in place a robust policy doing away with some cumbersome rules and brought in ease of doing business. In a short span, digital mapping of drones has been done in the country into red, green and yellow zones.

Secondly, the government has come out with the PLI scheme for promotion of the drone industry. ""For the first time, the PLI scheme was brought about for industry which was in a nascent stage,"" he said.

The PLI scheme for drone industry encompasses close to Rs 120 crore incentive for industry whose size in 2021 was only Rs 60 crore, he added

The minister further said the PLI scheme has yielded ""very good results"" as many companies have registered and the size of the industry has grown 6-8 times in the last one-and-a-half years.

Thirdly, the government is creating demand for drones and earmarked 12 ministries including agriculture for mandatory use of drone technology, he added.

The three-day event of the first G20 Agriculture Deputies Meeting of the Agriculture Working Group (AWG) will conclude on February 15.

It deliberated on four key priority areas: food security and nutrition; sustainable agriculture with climate smart approach; inclusive agriculture value chain and food supply system; and digitisation of agriculture transformation.",0
204,India appeals to G20 nations to adopt '3S' formula in agriculture for tackling food security concerns,"India on Tuesday called on G20 nations to adopt '3S' strategy - Smart, Sustainable and Serve - for the agriculture ecosystem in order to address the global food security concerns. Addressing media on the sidelines of the first G20 Agriculture Deputies' Meeting, Union Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said agriculture for India has always been a priority and for the world it has fully come to the fore now.

""Our thinking is we have to adopt 3S strategy for the agriculture ecosystem to make a mark on the world food system,"" Scindia said.

The 3S strategy is 'smart' and 'sustainable' agriculture which should 'serve' all, he said. For smart agriculture, Scindia emphasised on adopting drone and other new technologies for increasing the crop yield.

For sustainable agriculture, farmers should focus on achieving higher yields, use better inputs besides focusing on advanced technologies and marketing, he said.

Stating that India has made a significant progress in agriculture, the minister said it is the top nation in the world in milk production, second in vegetables and fruits and third in foodgrains production.

India's foodgrains output has risen from 265 million tonne to 315 million tonne in the last eight years. The budgetary outlay for the farm sector has been increased by four-and-half times to USD 10.5 billion (around Rs 86,700 crore) in the last eight years, he added.

Scindia, the union minister for civil aviation and steel, also mentioned that his home state Madhya Pradesh too has made a significant progress in the farm sector and is a major producer of soya and garlic.

The state's foodgrains output increased almost 4 times to 629 lakh tonne from 165 lakh tonne in last 18 years. Irrigation has improved by 50 per cent in the state, he said.

""Based on the outcome of the discussion, India and G-20 nations will provide a new road map for agriculture to the world,"" he added.

The first Agriculture Deputies Meeting of the Agriculture Working Group (AWG) under India's G20 presidency is being held here from February 13-15.

The second day of the meeting will continue deliberations on four key priority areas: food security and nutrition; sustainable agriculture with climate smart approach; inclusive agriculture value chain and food supply system; and digitisation of agriculture transformation.

209,Agriculture Budget 2023: Agriculture sector needs fresh fodder to improve farmer incomes,"The agriculture sector needs concerted steps in the impending budget to become advanced, competitive, and efficient, improve farmer incomes, and reduce its dependence on subsidies.
To be sure, India remains an agrarian economy. In fiscal 2022, agriculture and allied sectors accounted for 15-16% of the gross value added and employed ~46% of its population.
For the farming community and rural population, allocations under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Fertilizers and Ministry of Rural Development are most critical.
The growth in these allocations bears out the focus on the agriculture sector and rural development. While the overall budget has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% in the past decade (fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023), these allocations have increased at a CAGR of ~12%.",0
210,"Agriculture sector sprouts, needs reorientation","Indian agriculture has performed well, recording an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years, but the sector needs “re-orientation” in the backdrop of certain challenges including adverse impact of climate change, said the economic survey. The other challenges listed include rising input cost, fragmented landholdings, sub-optimal farm mechanisation, low productivity, disguised unemployment and rising input costs.
The survey noted that the agriculture sector has grown by 3% in 2021-22 compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. It said this growth was partly attributable to good monsoon years and partly to various government reforms.
It noted that India has also rapidly emerged as the net exporter of agricultural products. During 2021-22, agricultural exports reached an all-time high of $50.2 billion.
The survey attributes the sector’s growth and buoyancy to the “measures taken by the government to augment crop and livestock productivity, ensure certainty of returns to the farmers through price support (MSP), promote crop diversification” and, focused interventions to “enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanisation and boost horticulture and organic farming”.
It noted that other interventions such as PM-Kisan, strengthening of institutional finance and insurance through the PMFBY and the push given to Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) “have led to sustainable and inclusive development of the sector”.",0

Yet another area Hussain wants India Budget 2023 to focus is on a more agile import-export policy. More delegation of power from the Cabinet to an empowered group of ministers is recommended, he says. The aim, says Hussaim, should be that the landed cost of any agricultural commodity is not less than the minimum support price.
On the subject of whether India can be a major agricultural exporter, Hussain said the productivity levels need to go up significantly for that to happen.He said that India has only marginal agricultural surpluses which lead to export restrictions from time to time. ""Last year, the government banned the export of wheat and then non-basmati rice, except boiled rice and organic rice,"" Hussain substantiated.
""The government did the right thing by restricting the export of wheat and rice. And despite this, inflation in wheat is touching 20%. And inflation in rice is touching 10%,"" he said.",0

Lahari Bai, who belongs to the Baiga tribe from the Dindori district, has collected over the past decade dozens of varieties of millets, described as ‘Shree Anna' in this year's Union BudgetThe year 2023 has been declared by the United Nations as the International Year of the Millet, following a proposal by India, which wants to position itself as a global millet hub. The 3-day Agriculture Working Group meeting began on Monday as part of India's G20 presidency.

“Wherever I go, I look for millet seeds. I have made my seed bank by going from village to village in the past 10 years. It has seeds of about 60 varieties of the coarse grains,” she told PTI.

To preserve her rare collection of millets, Lahari Bai said she also grows the grains, which require much less water compared to rice. Sorghum (jowar), little millet (kutki), foxtail millet (kangni), pearl millet (bajra), and finger millet are among the many varieties found in India.

“I scatter the seeds of 16 types of millets in a field at one go. I deposit the seeds from such crops in my seed bank,” she said.

The tribal woman, who is unmarried and lives with her parents, said she distributes the seeds from her bank to the farmers of about 25 villages in her area to ensure that the coming generations benefit from the nutritious grains.

“It gives me great pleasure to distribute millet seeds. Our ancestors lived healthy and long by eating millets,” she said in her Baiga dialect.Her selfless work has now travelled far and wide. On February 9, PM Modi shared a report on her and tweeted, “We are proud of Lahari Bai who has shown remarkable enthusiasm for coarse grains. Her efforts will inspire many others.” Of the millet types preserved by Lahari Bai, applications have been filed for Geographical Indication (GI) for two little millet varieties, Sitahi and Nagdaman, said Dr Manisha Shyam, who is researching on millets at the Dindori Regional Agriculture Research Station under the Jabalpur-based Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University.

“Coarse cereals are very nutritious and had a special place in the Indian food plate. But after Green Revolution started in the country in the 1960s, the use of millets went down and they were replaced by wheat and rice,” she said.

Millets' were among the first crops to be domesticated in India with several evidence of its consumption during the Indus valley civilization. Being grown in more than 130 countries at present, millets are considered traditional food for more than half a billion people across Asia and Africa.",0

218,Silicon Valley Layoffs Blessing For Agricultural Equipment Makers,"Big agricultural and construction equipment manufacturers in the American Midwest are on a mission to lure Silicon Valley tech workers who have been caught up in a wave of hiring freezes and layoffs, executives told Reuters.
Mass layoffs at major tech firms have opened the talent pipeline for Illinois-based Deere & Co. - the world's largest tractor maker - and rivals who are eager to add tech workers to their payrolls as they expand into autonomous tractors, mining trucks, and other smart farming technology.With an abundance of job openings, the companies are offering remote work arrangements and opening new offices in major cities like Austin and Chicago, a potentially attractive draw for workers who don't want to move to smaller Midwestern cities, where many of the companies are based.

The executives said the newly available tech talent could inject much-needed expertise into farm equipment manufacturing, helping to transform the industry through the use of more artificial intelligence and automation.

Detroit automakers are also hiring tech workers to meet the growing software needs of vehicles, auto executives have said.

Historically, it has been difficult for construction and agriculture equipment manufacturers to compete with Silicon Valley compensation packages, Scott Wine, chief executive of CNH Industrial, an American-Italian machinery maker, said in an interview.

""They were sucking so much oxygen out of the air because of their significant budgets,"" Wine said. ""Now, they're not hiring and they're firing - so it just means we're getting a much larger pool of potential candidates that we can call upon.""

CNH hired more than 350 engineers last year, some of whom came from Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp, Wine said. CNH expects to spend more than $1.4 billion in research and development as the company scales precision agriculture offerings in 2023, he added.",0
219,"As Surplus Grows, France To Turn Leftover Wine Into Industrial Alcohol","Paris, France: France plans to spend millions of euros to turn wine into industrial alcohol for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics to drain a massive surplus, the agriculture ministry has said.
The world's second-largest wine producer after Italy, France has long been known as a nation of wine aficionados.But growers in the southwest region of Bordeaux say overproduction and a drop in domestic consumption of their more affordable brands have filled up their cellars and left them with nowhere to store the fruits of their next harvest.

The agriculture ministry said Monday that it would spend up to 160 million euros ($170 million) on distilling the tipple into industrial alcohol to use up some of the backlog.

In Bordeaux, winemaker Didier Cousiney said the amount was only enough to help each small business for just a couple of months when spread across the industry nationwide.

We have ""24 months' worth of backlog in our cellars"", he said.

Agriculture unions in the Bordeaux region, which have staged several protests, instead want compensation in exchange for uprooting part of their vineyards, a practice known as ""grubbing up"" the land.

This would help reduce production, and allow wine growers to repurpose the land for other activities.Cousiney and fellow growers estimate that at least 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of vineyards -- an area equivalent to 21,000 football pitches -- need to be grubbed up across the region to make a difference.

They are requesting compensation of 10,000 euros per hectare.

The government last sponsored distillation in 2020, after the worldwide Covid-19 lockdowns caused restaurants and bars to close down, and French wine exports to drop.

Around half a million people are estimated to work in the wine industry in France, according to the National Interprofessional Wine Commission.

If nothing is done, ""we fear between 100,000 and 150,000 jobs will be threatened in the coming decade"", the commission's head Bernard Farges warned in December.",0

Government statistics revealed a historic drop in the number of people for the first time since 1961. Major repercussions are seen by experts for China, its economy, and the entire world.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported on Tuesday that China's population fell by 850,000 people to 1.4118 billion in 2022 from 1.4126 billion in the previous year as a result of more deaths than birthsAccording to South China Morning Post, mothers in China had 9.56 million babies last year, a 9.98 percent drop from 10.62 million in 2021. The national birth rate fell to a record low of 6.77 births for every 1,000 people in 2022, down from 7.52 in 2021, marking the lowest rate since records began in 1949.

This is the first time since the Great Leap Forward, Mao Zedong's catastrophic economic experiment that resulted in widespread famine and death in the early 1960s, that more people died in China than were born.

Elements causing the population decline

The SCMP reported that the population reduction was attributed to a number of factors, including high child-rearing costs, the new generation's changing views on marriage and family, a slowing economy in the midst of China's strict coronavirus regulations, and declining economic growth.

The communist leadership loosened its 35-year-old one-child policy in 2016, allowing families to have two children, in an effort to balance the potential negative effects this population drop could have on China's economic growth.The nation increased the cap once more, to three, in 2021.",0

One kilogram of onions costs more than the Philippine minimum wage for a full day's work.


In the Philippines, a pound of red onions currently costs more than a pound of meat. This is a concern since the vegetable is a common ingredient in Filipino food. Food prices are being pressured worldwide as a result of global inflation, due to a host of causes including the Russia-Ukraine war, supply chain issues and extreme climate change, as per a report in Time Magazine. 
Red and white onions were sold for as much as 600 pesos (Rs 887) per kilogram, according to the agriculture department's analysis of market pricing in Manila as of January 9. The magazine stated that according to the market monitoring figures, the price is almost three times as expensive as chicken and 25 -50 per cent more expensive than pork or beef. One kilogram of onions costs more than the Philippine minimum wage for a full day's work.In order to supplement declining domestic supplies and stop price increases, the Philippines' agriculture authorities announced that the nation would have to resort to importing over 22,000 tonnes of onions by March. As per Time Magazine, the country's average monthly demand for the vegetable is around 17,000 metric tonnes.

Post a comment
It is noted that on December 30, the President of the Philippines Bongbong Marcos directed the trade department to set an onion ""suggested retail price"" of 250 pesos (Rs 369) per kilogram. Despite the price cap, onions continue to be expensive. The outlet also stated that Philippines  customs officials seized illegal red onions from China worth an estimated $362,000 (Rs 2.9 crore) hidden by boxes of bread and pastries and smuggled white onions worth $309,000 (Rs 2.5 crore) hidden in packages purporting to contain clothing.",0

225,"World Food Prices Hit Record High In 2022, Says UN Food Agency","Paris: World food prices eased in December marking the ninth consecutive monthly fall, but gained more than 14% in 2022 compared to the previous year, to reach the highest since records began, the UN food agency said on Friday.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) food price index, which tracks international prices of the most globally traded food commodities, averaged 132.4 points last month compared with a revised 135.00 points for November.The November figure was previously given as 135.7 points.

For 2022 as a whole, the benchmark index averaged 143.7 points, up 18 points or 14.3% from 2021, and the highest since records started in 1990.

The decline in the index in December was driven by a steep drop in the international price of vegetable oils, together with some declines in cereal and meat prices, but mitigated by slight increases in those of sugar and dairy, the FAO said.Food prices surged after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February last year on fears of disruptions to Black Sea trade. They have pared gains in part because of a UN-backed grain export channel from Ukraine.

The FAO said last year that food import costs in 2022 would lead the poorest countries to cut back on shipped volumes.

228,SEBI Extends Suspension Of Derivatives Trade In 7 Commodities Till December 2023,"New Delhi: Capital markets regulator Sebi has extended the suspension of futures and options trading in seven agricultural commodities, including wheat and moong, for one more year till December 2023 in a bid to rein in prices.
The other agricultural commodities suspended by Sebi are -- paddy (non-basmati), chana, crude palm oil, mustard seeds and their derivatives and soya bean and its derivatives. ""The suspension of trading in the above contracts has been extended for one more year beyond December 20, 2022, i.e. till December 20, 2023,"" Sebi said in a statement on Wednesday.The suspension permits squaring up of existing positions in these commodities, but no fresh futures trading is permitted in them for a year. To curb inflation, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on December 2021 prohibited exchanges from launching new derivative contracts of Soyabean, mustard seeds, channa, wheat, paddy, moong and crude palm oil. These directions were applicable for one year.

Earlier this month, the Commodity Participants Association of India (CPAI) had urged the government and Sebi to allow exchanges to resume trading in these seven agricultural derivatives contracts.In its letter to the Finance Ministry and Sebi, the association had said the prolonged bans are detrimental to the Indian commodity market ecosystem and severely dent the perception regarding India's ease of doing business environment.During the last one year, the price of some of these commodities has been below or around MSP, and many studies concluded that the commodity prices are predominantly governed by supply and demand factors, and trading on exchanges has no impact on the price, CPAI had mentioned.

The association suggested that easily reversible options, such as increasing margin and lowering open interest limits for commodity derivatives contracts may be resorted to in case significant volatility is observed in agri-commodity contracts.",0
