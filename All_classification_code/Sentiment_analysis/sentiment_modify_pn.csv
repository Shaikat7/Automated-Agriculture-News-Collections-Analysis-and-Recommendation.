The highly popular Bengali sweet, available only during winter months, is highly perishable

For the first time in its history, the Joynagar moa , a highly popular Bengali sweet that is available only during the winter months, is being exported.

The first trial shipment reached Bahrain on Wednesday and the exporter had received a repeat order that’s double the 45 kg already sent.

The moa is a popped-rice ball held together with fresh date-palm jaggery, and since its manufacture is mostly confined to the town of Joynagar (near Kolkata), it has earned the Geographical Indication tag of Joynagar Moa.

There has always been a demand for the Joynagar moa from Bengalis living abroad but since the sweet is highly perishable — it can hold its taste and texture for only 5-7 days under normal refrigeration — its commercial export was never seriously contemplated.

Reaches Bahrain

“The moa , which was sent by air on Tuesday, reached Bahrain in perfect condition. The customers have already collected it. They are so happy that they have already placed a repeat order, which is twice the amount of what we had sent as trial,” said Susmita Dutta of the Kolkata-based DM Enterprise, an exporter of fresh vegetables, fruits and processed food. The consignment was set along with 105 kg of date-palm jaggery.

The local unit of the APEDA (Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority), which facilitated the export, is equally elated. “This should have happened long ago, and we are glad it has happened now. The moa is now among the very few agricultural GI-tagged items, such as basmati rice, Darjeeling tea and Alphonso mango, to be exported. We feel proud,” said Sandeep Saha, APEDA regional in charge.

“The next step would be reaching the moa to other countries. There’s already demand from Italy, Canada and Dubai. We are working on that. I am also pitching for its export to Indonesia. Without promotion, the popularity of the moa will remain confined to Bengal. One feeds proud at the thought of the sweet sailing the clouds and reaching overseas destinations,” Mr. Saha said.

From 1904

The history of moa can be traced back to 1904 and it has always been synonymous with Joynagar even though many other adjoining settlements also specialise in it. The sweetmeat is made of aromatic khoi — popped rice — mixed with jaggery, sugar, cashew nuts and raisins.

Today moa -making is an organised business, run by the Joynagar Moa Nirmankari Society. The society earned the GI tag from the Commerce Ministry in March 2015 and so far, 26 of the 46 manufacturers registered with the society have received the certificate to make Joynagar moa — the remaining 20 applications are still under process.",1

Planting dates are the foundation for climate resilience and productivity outcomes in eastern India, research has found. Photo: Wikimedia Commons

The sowing dates of wheat have maximum influence on its yield, superseding all other crop management, soil and varietal factors, new research has found. Adjusting sowing dates in eastern parts of the country will increase production by 69 per cent, said a study by Cornell University, the United States.

Advancing the rice crop calendar by up to two weeks is technically feasible and will help wheat productivity, it found. The greater production will help ensure food security and farm profitability as the planet warms.

The research said:

Better managing the annual cropping calendar will pay dividends for food security, profitability and climate resilience.

The report, Time Management Governs Climate Resilience and Productivity in the Coupled Rice-Wheat Cropping Systems of Eastern India, was published July 21 in Nature Food.

The researchers studied 2.25 million hectares of farmland cultivating wheat-paddy in Bihar and seven adjacent districts in Uttar Pradesh. Wheat is sown between early November and late December, with harvest extending from late March through April in these areas.

Rice alternates with wheat on the agricultural calendar, with farmers growing rice in the wet season and wheat in the dry one.

The study divided the data into three — early (before November 20), medium (November 20 to December 4) and late (after December 4). The yield increased by 69 per cent for fields sown in early November (5.4 tonnes per hectare) compared with those in late December (3.2 tonnes per hectare).

A bulk of the sowing, 59 per cent, takes place after December 1. Moving it up by two weeks can lead to a 36 per cent increase in yield, said the study.

The data can be crucial for resilient climate farming in the country, said Devinder Sharma, an agricultural expert. “Policymakers need to take note of this and help design an agriculture calendar so that paddy transplantation can happen earlier,” he noted.

A calendar that balances both wheat and rice yields is needed, according to Sharma. “Moving to short-duration paddy varieties might be one solution. These crops are also more climate resilient, but farmers often prefer long-duration rice as they have a better yield. However, this harms their wheat production by delaying sowing dates,” he added.

Planting wheat earlier helps the crop avoid heat stress as it matures, the study said. The heat stress is triggered by the rise in soil and air temperatures, causing permanent harm to plant growth.

The research also found that rice productivity will not be hampered by early wheat sowing, a key consideration for farmers.

“This process has confirmed that planting dates are the foundation for climate resilience and productivity outcomes in eastern India,” said Andrew McDonald, the study’s first author.

McDonald is an associate professor at the school of integrative plant science, soil and crop sciences section at Cornell University.

An almost 70 per cent increase in yield by just moving forward the sowing dates is remarkable and should be tested out on a large scale, farmers’ activist Ramandeep Singh noted, adding, “However, farmers will need assurance they will get proper rates for such high yields.”

The researchers worked with the Indian Agricultural Research Council for several years. The team studied complex farm realities using big data analytics. It also determined key agricultural management practices in smaller farms.

The study provided new recommendations for rice sowing dates and types of cultivars. “Farmers are not just managing single crops. They are managing a sequence of decisions,” said McDonald, who has a joint appointment in the global development department.

Cultivation of climate-resilient wheat starts with rice, he added.

South Asia’s principal wheat-growing area is the Indo–Gangetic plain. Wheat yield gaps in the Eastern Gangetic plain are among the highest in India. The research attributed these gaps to late sowing, use of older cultivars, complex weed flora, variable access and low utilisation of irrigation water and labour shortages.

The study also said India will need to produce 30 per cent more wheat by 2050.",1
796460,Bridging Gaps: This Chhattisgarh farmer’s collective champions sustainability,"This farmer-producer organisation in Dantewada follows a decentralised process

Just like any other entrepreneur, all a farmer needs is an assured market and a better deal.

Akash Badave realised this as soon as he started working with tribal communities of Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district a decade ago.

As a Prime Minister’s Rural Development Fellow, he was assigned to help the district administration improve the livelihoods of marginal communities.

Dantewada is in the spotlight for high level of malnutrition; for instance, as per the fifth round of the National Family Health Survey (2019-21), some 76 per cent of women aged 15-49 years in the district are anaemic.

The national average for the same group is 57 per cent. Previous attempts to improve nutritional status of people in the district, by enhancing agricultural production through chemical fertilisers and pesticides, had few takers.

“The chemicals killed all our earthworms and made our soil lifeless,” says Rameshwar Yadav, a farmer in the district’s Balud village.

In 2012, the district administration decided to motivate farmers to turn to organic farming and to grow crops other than traditional paddy and millet varieties.

But the exercise, says Badave, in-charge of the sensitisation programme, highlighted farmers’ reluctance to grow more or new crops.

Even if individual farmers grew surplus, there was a lack of market linkages for their harvest. The district, covered with dense forests and mineral-rich hills, has limited connectivity.

Though the government procures certain crops at minimum support price (MSP), it benefits few.

There is only one mandi for procurement of produce, which is out of reach for many. There is no system to procure organic produce.

However, following the repeated sensitisation programmes, the communities at one Krishi Mela proposed to set up a farmer-producer organisation (FPO).

Registered under the Companies Act, 2013, an FPO enables collectivisation of produce to help farmers reap benefits of the economies of scale.

Thus in 2016, the Bhoomgaadi Organic Farmer’s Producer Company Limited was set up in Dantewada, with Badave as chief executive.

The FPO follows a decentralised process. At the village level, farmers are arranged into groups, including women’s self-help groups. Some 10-12 villages form a cluster that elects a director to the FPO’s board.

Bhoomgaadi received funding from the district administration as a one-time loan of Rs 50 lakh under the district mineral fund, set up for welfare of mining-affected areas.

The FPO also gets additional funds of Rs 1 crore annually from the fund through Nirmaan, a Hyderabad-based civil society organisation.

Channels opened

Marketing is all about strategies. So to begin with, Bhoomgadi introduced a brand name — ‘Aadim’, which means ‘indigenous and original’ — under which it procures and sells produce of three categories — paddy, millets and pulses; native varieties of spices (coriander, turmeric, dry mango powder, red chillies); and minor forest products (tamarind, East Indian arrow root, almondette, mahua, sickle senna).

It has 50 raw, semi-processed and processed products in its catalogue.

To market the products, Bhoomgaadi employs a dual approach — it pitches unique native varieties like the aromatic Javaphul, Lokati Machi and medicinal Sathka rice to create new demand, while popular varieties like bold rice cater to existing demand.

The FPO first began selling the products through the Centre’s Tribal Co-operative Marketing Federation of India (TRIFED). Next, for processed products, it introduced two channels — loose sales of products in bulk, and white-packet sales, wherein the FPO packs items for sale by select companies.

Further, Bhoomgaadi has opened an outlet called “Jaiwik Bazar” in the district headquarters to sell the products, as well as an “Aadim Café” that serves food prepared with organic produce.

In terms of procurement, the FPO currently buys from 570 farmer groups, including non-members, at 20-25 per cent higher rates than MSP.

“The open market price for the Sathaka variety of paddy, for instance, is Rs 8-12 per kg and we buy it at Rs 21 per kg,” says Shashank Guwalani, lead of operations, Bhoomgadi.

“The FPO gives fair prices on all crops, with premium prices for aromatic and medicinal rice varieties. It buys produce round the year. This has enhanced income,” says Surendra Nag, an organic farmer of Kasoli village in the district.

“The cost of 1 kg of rice is about Rs 55 after factoring in transportation, storage, and milling. We then sell it for Rs 65,” he adds.

The FPO accrues a profit of 15-30 per cent on maximum retail price, depending on the commodity, sale model and quantity.

While it recorded a nearly five-fold growth within a year of its inception, there have been dips in the turnover due to the government offering improved MSPs and COVID-19 (see ‘On a steady track’,).

But it expects growth exceeding 25 per cent over the previous year.

Organic benefits

From 10 members in two-three village in 2016-17, Bhoomgaadi’s membership has grown to 2,727 members from 122 villages in 2020, with another 316 currently in the process of joining.

The increase in income has prompted farmers to raise efforts to improve livelihoods. They find that reduced input costs,

better yields, and greater control over farming decisions with regenerative practices decrease cultivation costs and increase earnings.

Over the past five years, farmers have undertaken capacity-building exercises, organised by Bhoomgadi.

“We were taught how to make organic manures and remedies to get rid of pests and diseases, along with techniques like Systemic Rice Intensification (SRI) and mixed farming,” says Balram Singh Thakur of Balud village.

In SRI, paddy is sowed at measured distances of 22.86 cm (9 inches). It reduces water needed to irrigate the crop and deters pests. Kamal Singh Nag, a farmer from Bichauli village, says the technique has helped decrease labour costs and time.

In 2016, he sold 1,000-2,000 kg of paddy; this rose to 4,500 kg in 2020—earning him roughly Rs 82,300 more.

The FPO invites experts to educate farmers, and sends members to training centres and other states to learn new techniques. Anand Netam, deputy director of agriculture, Dantewada, says, “Bhoomgaadi reaches places that the state fails to reach.

Farmers in deep pockets of the land find it hard to work with government officials, but they respond well to the FPO.”

To ensure nutrition and food security, Bhoomgaadi emphasises on crop diversification. Although the quantity produced so far is too low to be procured, residents have started consuming more fruits and vegetables.

While this shift in diet has not been studied so far, they report some changes. “I feel more energetic and can work for longer hours now,” says Chandrasekhar Singh, a farmer from Balud village.

Building better

The lessons learnt so far have helped Bhoomgaadi identify areas for future growth. For instance, the number of rice varieties marketed has been reduced from 100 to 25-30, in line with demand.

Similarly, to streamline collection, the FPO has launched 23 procurement centres at the cluster level, in lieu of procuring produce from farmers’ doorsteps. It is working to upscale its processing unit, with plans for a better manufacturing facility and training centre.

The FPO is also working to shift from catering to business and governments to reach consumers directly. However, Badave admits this would be a challenge, as although Bhoomgaadi has received adequate support, FPOs typically see poor funding and hand-holding assistance.

Hiring human resources is also a challenge. Transportation is another concern, says Gulawani. “The nearest town to Dantewada with better connectivity is Jagdalpur, 80-90 km away.

Shipping costs render online sales unviable.” The district has a low literacy rate and finding a skilled workforce is difficult.

Certification for organic produce also sees hurdles. The FPO uses the Participatory Guarantee System. “Dantewada has low internet penetration. Most farmers do not have proper land records.Both are needed for th certification,” says Jaswinder Singh, lead of organic certification at the FPO.

It seeks to register the villages for Large Area Certification (LAC) under Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna. “LAC requirements are simple and the area can be certified almost immediately,” says Badave. It is looking at third-party certification as well. “But the regulatory system is a bit unfair towards organic farming,” he adds.

(This is the first in a series of multiple reports that show how better market access to non-chemical produce is key to the success of regenerative agriculture)

796488,There is a need to introduce climate-smart agriculture in Africa',"In the southern African region, lack of sufficient rainfall led to failed harvests

In view of the looming food security crisis across the southern African region, respective governments and humanitarian agencies are stepping up their efforts to ensure that people do not face a tough time in the coming months.

According to an assessment made by the World Food Programme (WFP), the food assistance wing of the United Nations, around 1.5 million people in Zimbabwe will face hunger in the lean season. The government and several agencies are trying to protect vulnerable people from food insecurity.

David Orr, the regional spokesman for WFP in southern Africa, speaks to Down To Earth about food shortage in Africa and what it needs to do to achieve self-sufficiency in crop production.

What is to be blamed for Africa’s food shortage—lack of self-sufficiency in production or a gap in the distribution system?

The food security situation is precarious in Africa. There is supply problem as well and the crisis is more pronounced in Malawi and Zimbabwe. The situation is worrisome in Angola, Mozambique and Madagascar too.

The situation is bad due to erratic weather patterns and dry spells. In the southern African region, rains arrived late last year and did not continue throughout January-February. Lack of sufficient rainfall led to failed harvests.

The flood in Malawi early this year affected a million people. Around 2.4 million people are food insecure in Malawi.

People do not have access to enough food. There is going to be difficulty in the lean period in Zimbabwe (beginning September this year) and will continue till the harvest is over.

How bad is the situation in Zimbabwe after the crash in maize production?

Zimbabwe has witnessed 50 per cent loss in harvest. Both Malawi and Zimbabwe need to import food as the domestic supply is not enough. There is a need for these countries to supplement the domestic food supply.

The good thing is that both these countries have national cereal stocks to be distributed by the government. The WFP will be working to aid in the distribution.

We are planning reach out to 200,000 people in Zimbabwe by the end of this year and 400,000 by early next year.

Prices have started to rise and it will become difficult for the poor to buy food.

Why is the sub-Saharan African region marked by unreliable food access and undernourishment?

Some of the factors affecting food security include population growth, conflicts, displacement, lack of infrastructure, transportation and difficulty of farmers in accessing fertilizers.

In the southern African region, stunting (reduced growth of children) is very high. Around 40 per cent of children suffer from stunting due to the lack of balanced diet.

Another big issue is HIV/AIDS in the southern African region which affects the nutritional state of the people. Treatments are possible only when there is enough nutrition.

Climate change is another big challenge. The most vulnerable are subsistence farmers who are prone to climate shocks. Extreme weather events are recurring and persistent. They are not isolated events and are increasing since the past 20 years.

There is 90 per cent indication of El Nino occurring in the next agricultural season, leading to reduced rainfall. The WFP is working with governments and other partners to increase the resilience of communities so that they can withstand climate shocks.

Does Africa need food security or self-sufficiency in food production?

Agriculture in Africa is mostly practiced by small-scale farmers. One of the main challenges is to empower them, give them the option to store their produce and market it.

Most people in Africa are subsistence farmers and operate on a low scale. The challenge for the local governments and the WFP is to increase their capacity.

Introducing assistance to farmers is something that the FAO and the local governments are working on. In most areas, agriculture is a challenge as it is dependent on rainfall.

There is a need to introduce climate-smart agriculture and water conservation system to make local communities resistant to droughts and floods. Governments should put in place early warning weather system and strategies. Various agencies are working with African governments to put these things in place.

796760,"How a noxious aquatic weed was used to make eco-friendly products, generate employment in rural Bengal","Demand for woven baskets, cups, plates, boxes and other cottage industry products is high in the state, neighbouring areas

Water hyacinth, scientifically known as Eichhornia crassipes Mart. (Pontederiaceae), is an aquatic weed common in waterbodies across South Asia, including India.

This is not an indigenous species but was introduced to India during the British colonial rule as an ornamental aquatic plant from South America. The plant produces beautiful purple flowers that have high aesthetic value.

This simple, floating aquatic plant, unfortunately, is also an obnoxious weed that has been suffocating surface freshwater sources like rivers, rivulets, streams, ponds, dams, lakes and bogs, making the waterbodies unsuitable for commercial fishery, transportation and recreation.

The plant is a prolific vegetable matter-producer and has the ability to choke out any closed waterbody at an astonishing rate. This cuts off sunlight as well as reduces oxygen level in the water, making it unfit for commercial use.

It is an expensive and labour-intensive process to remove this weed from time to time. This water hyacinth has become a serious problem plant for the ecosystem. The plant has been used as a bio-fertiliser in some organic agriculture practises, but it is mostly a nuisance plant detrimental to both ecosystem and environment.

However, it has been reported that this plant is a good phytoremediation species, suggesting it has the ability to trap and remove toxic metabolites and harmful heavy metals from water. But more research needs to be conducted to find suitable use for the notorious weed.

A stitch in time

Bikram Mitra from Kolkata, West Bengal has made an outstanding example by utilising this obnoxious aquatic weed plant to develop small-scale cottage industry that is both financially rewarding as well as environmentally friendly in approach.

Mitra has always been passionate about working for the environment and has been an advertising and marketing executive by profession. But in 2011, he decided to leave his job and started working as an entrepreneur himself on environmental projects.

His initial work has been on the reduce-reuse-recycle initiative on plastics in the environment. But over time, he became interested in working with environmentally friendly, biodegradable natural products.

He meticulously studied and trained himself to use water hyacinth stems in preparing biodegradable paper. Slowly, he mastered the craft and started designing biodegradable cups, plates, boxes and other environmentally friendly daily-use products that are cheaper and can serve as an alternative for plastic and thermocol cups, plates, dishes and glasses.

He has now successfully established his own, small cottage industry-based workshop in North Kolkata, along with his associates Abhijit Mandal and Sanjay Bose under an organization named Earth Trust.

Bikram Mitra, who set up the cottage industry, at Kuda village, Purulia, West Bengal. Photo: Saikat Kumar Basu

Although the techniques and protocols were initially developed at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, the lab-to-land transition has not been quite successful. Now, Mitra and his core team have been running a series of workshops and training programmes across West Bengal on making sustainable products from water hyacinth stems.

A large section of the students participating in these workshops are women representing various age groups. This is highly inspiring as several of the successful participants have become small-scale producers in their rural areas and running small units from their residences or under cooperatives.

The self-employed rural women are not only earning extra money to support their families but are also serving as local trainers for Mitra.

Thus, within the last five years, the network has developed strongly in rural Bengal and shows promises for rural employment in the not-so-distant future.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted both the business and training programs in the past two years. But it is catching up again as there is a lot of interest in the products among the public.

The biggest advantage of the initiative is that the manufacturing units are located close to their raw material sources. The water hyacinth plants grow abundantly round the year in local fresh water bodies. They are also available free-of-cost to the producers. Transportation cost is also minimised due to close proximity of the manufacturing units to raw material sources.

Expanding cottage industry

Bulk orders of products were placed through his workshops not only from West Bengal but also from adjacent states, indicating future expansion of this cottage industry. There is a need for developing marketing strategies, development of local markets, pricing and proper distribution of such eco-friendly products, along with initial government and / or non-government funding support to make this enterprise reach a large number of producers as well as consumers.

The producer can employ local highly skilled, well-trained labour to produce the biodegradable and environment-friendly products. These are then bought in bulk by retailers, who sell them to various distributors operating in various cities, towns, malls and markets.

Thus, a dedicated network of business entrepreneurs have been developed for water hyacinth-based products, serving both economy and ecology together in an integrated fashion. Mitra has even moved his craft to a higher level by designing both hand- and machine-based manufacturing of water hyacinth stem ropes to make woven baskets, containers, bags, hats and caps.

He is working hard to train more people in these areas so that they can become economically independent while helping the environment to thrive.

South Indian states (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala) are now leaders in this area, Mitra said. Such entrepreneurial initiatives began in these states about three decades ago.

In West Bengal, however, such initiatives were rolled out only in the last 8-10 years. But the enterprise now has immense potential for the state in the rural sector and can employ a number of rural youths, particularly women.

Mitra had funding support from NABARD and Rural Innovative Fund when he started this environment-friendly initiative around 2011. The financial support has now increased substantially under various government schemes and hence, he emphasised that rural youths can now take advantage of these to set up small rural units, according to him.

He is looking for partners, collaborators and funding institutes to join his efforts.

The biggest challenge for Mitra and other entrepreneurs has been getting adequate funding for running these programs and lack of opportunities for marketing these products, he said.

Although the funding opportunities have improved to some extent over the last few years, the limitations of proper marketing restricted the reach of these excellent natural products.

However, he is hopeful that the situation will improve opening this up as a stable cottage industry in future, competing with South Indian states that are miles ahead in production, circulation and marketing of various natural biodegradable products from plant-based sources such as coconut, jute and cotton.

796779,Why India needs to bring back nature-positive farming,"The pandemic showed that human interventions in natural processes can have disastrous consequences; we should now scale up natural-positive food systems that would simultaneously promote crop, soil and human health

There is growing consensus among agri-scientists, policymakers and farmers that the Green Revolution has reached its limits and raised several issues of environmental sustainability. Photo: Agnimirh Basu / CSE

In the mid-1960s, the new strategy of intensive application of modern agricultural practices in relatively resource-rich regions fundamentally transformed the farming sector in India.

In the initial years of what we now know as the Green Revolution (GR), India’s food production grew at an unprecedented scale and farm incomes also improved substantially.

High yielding varieties of seeds, chemical fertilisers, assured irrigation and pesticides were key components of this high-input technology. However, the rise in food production has come at a price in the form of groundwater depletion, land degradation, yield stagnation, loss of agri-biodiversity and the long-term impact on farmers’ and consumers’ health.

There is growing consensus among agri-scientists, policymakers and farmers that the GR has reached its limits and raised several issues of environmental sustainability.

It is now time to move from resource-intensive to sustainable agriculture. The Budget 2022-23 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent call to take agriculture out of chemical laboratories and connect it with nature’s laboratory reaffirms this realisation.

A holistic approach

The call now is to move away from extractive and input-intensive practices towards a low external input and sustainable system of agriculture. There are different forms of this ranging from organic to natural to pesticide-free farming.

The overarching intention is to bring a more holistic approach to farming thereby reducing the use of chemicals in farming without affecting the yields.

While the GR-promoted standardisation was centred on wheat and rice, sustainable farming brings back diversity to farming by promoting crops and crop-varieties suited to different agroecological zones of India.

The transition to natural farming and organic farming however, is a lengthy process. Years of depletion of natural nutrients and soil degradation make a complete withdrawal of synthetic chemical fertilisers a difficult proposition as it would bring down yields and affect the incomes of the small and marginal farmers.

Pesticides, on the other hand, are relatively easy to be replaced. Non Pesticide Management (NPM) agriculture encourages farmers to engage in synthetic pesticide-free agriculture and create a unique identity for this produce in the consumer market.

Since 2005, farmers who follow the NPM approach have adopted a range of immensely beneficial practices to increase the natural defences of the crop ecosystem and maintain soil health.

This starts with choosing pest-resistant varieties of crops and practicing crop rotation, intercropping and mixed cropping that are well adapted to the local agroecological systems to enhance the overall health of the crop ecosystem.

If there is need, farmers go for preventive and curative sprays of locally prepared bio-inputs and herbal extracts that keep pests at bay. Most of these bio-inputs are made by the farmers themselves with locally available materials that reduce their costs and debts considerably.

Farmers use natural alternatives such as a mix of chili, ginger, garlic, neem to ward off bad pests without harming the good pests (earthworms, birds, etc) and prevent an ecosystem imbalance. In these ways, they replace expensive and toxic chemical pesticides with natural substitutes that are fairly less expensive.

This shift in thinking is also timely as awareness about the need to avoid chemical-laden foods has increased exponentially among Indian consumers post the pandemic.

Consumers are now more conscious of where their food comes from, the nutritive value, processes followed and are willing to pay a small premium for a superior product.

Since the leading threat to consumer health from food comes from pesticide residue, going pesticide-free is the most practical and sustainable option for consumers in addition to its benefits for farmers and the environment.

The way forward

Farmers recognise the ill-effects of using chemicals on their land and health. But this is not enough to encourage them to switch to natural or pesticide-free farming.

One of the major lessons of the GR experience is that immense state support is needed for such a transition to take place in the farm sector. There is a need to provide end-to-end support to farmers to create an enabling environment for this transition.

First, we have to identify and establish cultivation practices that are crop, soil and region-specific. More agricultural research has to go into developing seed varieties and cultivation practices using locally available materials.

Second, more support is needed for post-harvest management in areas such as transportation, storage and value addition. Since chemical contamination can also occur after the produce leaves the farm, we need to follow the value / supply chain approach and cover all aspects.

Third, the incentive system available to crops has to change. The present system of minimum support price-based public procurement is concentrated in a few areas and crops. Diversification of the procurement basket is important to ensure they get a fair price for their produce.

Fourth, provision of financial services like credit and insurance at affordable price is vital for a vibrant and efficient farming system. Crop insurance, as a risk mitigation mechanism, can protect the small and marginal farmers from climate variations.

Fifth, farmer collectives and farmer producer organisations (FPO) need to play a big role in the transition to a sustainable and pesticide-free farming system. While many farmers practice natural farming producing a superior quality product, their produce tends to be clubbed with conventional produce.

To overcome this, organisations like Safe Harvest, where I work, partner with FPOs to procure directly from farmers at the farmgate and give their produce the recognition it deserves.

Farmers practicing NPM and working with Safe Harvest earn approximately 20 per cent more than farmers cultivating conventionally. This encourages small and marginal farmers to continue farming sustainably.

Finally, there is need for support to encourage entry of many MSMEs in the pesticide-free food chains and to raise awareness among the consumers on a large scale, to raise demand and develop territorial markets.

The pandemic has reinforced the need to search for sustainable and nature positive ways of living and working. The pandemic showed that human interventions in natural processes can have disastrous consequences.

This is an opportune moment to scale up natural-positive farming and food systems that would simultaneously promote crop, soil and human health and also inform us how we should respect and never overstep our planetary boundaries.

796783,"Magical mushroom: Scaling up Ganoderma lucidum cultivation will benefit farmers, users","Ganoderma lucidum has over 400 chemical constituents with medicinal properties

Ganoderma lucidum is a medicinal mushroom in use for centuries to heal diseases like diabetes, cancer, inflammation, ulcer as well as bacterial and skin infections. In India, however, the potential of the fungus is still being explored.

It is considered one of the most important medicinal mushrooms in the world since its chemical constituents exhibit numerous medicinal properties. They have earned it monikers such as “mushroom of immortality”, “celestial herb” and “auspicious herb”. It is globally also known as “red reishi mushroom”.

The history of consumption of this mushroom can be traced back to 5,000 years ago in China. It also finds mention in the historical and medical records of countries like Japan, Korea, Malaysia and India.

Unlike normal mushrooms, the peculiar character of this one is that it grows on wood or wood-based substrate only.

With time, many researchers recognised this fungus and tried to identify its constituents and properties. The research is still in progress and many interesting facts are being discovered.

Ganoderma contains more than 400 chemical constituents, including triterpenes, polysaccharides, nucleotides, alkaloids, steroids, amino acids, fatty acids and phenols. These show medicinal properties such as immunomodulatory, anti-hepatitis, anti-tumour, antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-HIV, antimalarial, hypoglycaemic and anti-inflammatory properties.

The mushroom is shiny red-brown in colour and naturally grows on wood. It prefers broad-leaved tree species like acacia, poplar, oak, maple, melia, eucalyptus, hevea, tectona and grewia.

The lower surface of this mushroom is porous, pale white in colour and produces red spores on maturity. It thrives well in warm and humid climates, and grows preferably in mixed forests of sub-tropical to temperate regions.

Attempts are being made to popularise this mushroom for business and livelihood, by cultivating it on wood logs and sawdust. Earlier it was only collected from the wild but its increasing demand pushed the attempts to artificially cultivate it.

The first successful artificial cultivation was done in 1969 by technicians of the Chinese Academy of Science. Since then, this mushroom has been cultivated in various wood logs as well as sawdust substrates, with wheat bran, tea leaves, cotton husk and others being the additional substrates.

The mother culture of Ganoderma lucidum is commonly prepared from its fruiting body by tissue culture method; it is further used to prepare its spawn.

The mushroom takes about a month to mature in sawdust substrate but is mostly harvested once. On wood log substrate, it takes about 15 days to colonise and approximately 3-4 months to mature, with about three subsequent harvests.

Apart from medicines, Ganoderma lucidum is also used as a base material for manufacturing products such as tea, coffee, energy supplements, health boosters, beverages, baked goods and anti-ageing cosmetics.

Scope in India

The reason the mushroom has not gained as much popularity as other herbal products might be the fact that its mass production is restricted to countries like China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand and the United States of America.

Most of the Ganoderma products produced in these countries are consumed domestically and a very limited quantity of raw material is exported. The large-scale industries in the Ganoderma business belong mostly to these countries, and so, the products are expensive in the rest of the world.

Awareness regarding Ganoderma is spreading and the demand of this mushroom has pushed many countries, including India, to produce it on a large scale and manufacture its products.

Its current production, however, is not sufficient to meet its increasing demand, and thus there is a need to cultivate this mushroom on a large scale.

India, a country where a majority of population primarily relies on agriculture, has great potential to cultivate this mushroom. It can be grown indoors and is thus safe from the impacts of extreme weather conditions, man-wildlife conflicts, harsh topography and poor soil conditions.

In India, the mushroom is mostly restricted to laboratory research at present. Some successful attempts for its cultivation, however, have been made by various Indian organisations.

It is cultivated on wood logs (locally called billets) in the country.

Ganoderma lucidum can have immense potential for livelihood generation, but there are some challenges as well. Due to the increasing demand of herbal and natural health products during the pandemic, a window of opportunity has been created for its cultivation and marketing on a large scale in India.

The dried fruiting bodies or raw powder of Ganoderma lucidum can be sold at Rs 4,000-5000 per kilogram.

There is a need to specifically work toward chemical analysis, quality assessment and marketing of the mushroom grown by farmers, in order to commercialise the products.

At present, we rely on other countries for raw materials and are importing it to fulfil its demand in India. Thus, Ganoderma lucidum has every potential for entrepreneurship as well as livelihood opportunity in India and only needs proper scaling up among the farmers.

796800,Farmer who Grows Hundreds of Fruits and Vegetables In One Orchard!,"Gurdeep Singh recently went live on Krishi Jagran’s Facebook page.

Gurdeep Singh is an independent farmer based in Jawalamukhi, Himachal Pradesh. He has cultivated a sprawling, 55 kanal orchard on his land. Singh grows chikoo and many varieties of mango including langda, chausa, dusheri, and alphonso. He is especially proud of his chikoos which, he says, are larger in size than an average cricket ball. There are also other fruit plants in his orchard like pomegranates and mosambi.

Thanks to a scheme by ATMA (Agricultural Technology Management Agency), Singh learnt at Panchayat-level meetings the art of cultivating fruit plants. They first sowed mango seeds and then did grafting on them. Along with Singh, there are many other farmers who practice similar techniques on their orchard. Moreover, they grow vegetables along with fruits: taro, cauliflower, broccoli, beetroot, and fenugreek are some of the vegetables they grow.

The most important thing, Singh says, is that they market their vegetables themselves. In an exposure visit organized by Agriculture Department, he visited Rythu Bazaar in Hyderabad and observed how farmers directly marketed their products. This eliminates the role of middlemen and farmers get the full benefits of what is sold.

Singh displays his roadside vendor store to Krishi Jagran’s correspondent as he explains how it gives him a greater control of his own livelihood.

At the silver jubilee of CSK Himachal Pradesh Agricultural University, Palampur, Singh was awarded the “Kisan Doot” award. He emphasizes how he has been helped by various governmental entities in the country at each step of his farming career.

Singh’s message to all the farmers of the country is to diversify the range of the crops and plants they grow. He urges them to give up working on just traditional crops and experiment as much as they can. For instance, he says, farmers can grow cucumbers, turmeric, ginger and other vegetables and fruits. He also asks the job-seeking youth of India to move in the direction of farming and self-dependency.",1
796801,Mushroom King of Rajasthan: Meet the Farmer Who Churns a Huge Profit by Cultivating Mushrooms,"Krishi Jagran conducted a special session with Motaram Sharma for its Farmer the Brand (FTB) section.

Motaram Sharma is a mushroom farmer based in Sikar, Rajasthan. In the recent years, mushroom cultivation has become quite popular among farmers but Sharma has been practicing it for over three decades!

He cultivates a wide range of mushrooms including button mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, and milky mushrooms. His mushrooms are sold for as much as 100 Rupees per kilogram to 2 lakh Rupees per kilogram. He has also earned awards like Krishi Ratna Award and Krishi Samrat Award, and has been given the title of ‘Mushroom King.’

Earning Ten Times More as a Farmer

Sharma explains that with the help of mushroom cultivation, farmers can actually earn ten times more than their present income (Krishi Jagran had also previously placed mushroom cultivation among the 20 most profitable agricultural businesses in India). Mushroom farming requires neither a huge investment nor a large plot of land. The roof under which mushrooms are cultivated can be used as a water source for mushroom farming throughout the year. There are some mushrooms which can be grown without air-conditioning in India like milky mushrooms and button mushrooms.

On the other hand some mushrooms necessarily require air-conditioning. Sharma suggests farmers to set out with those varieties of mushrooms which most suits their investment limits. The only things required would be shade and proper ventilation. Sharma further encourages farmers to get trained in mushroom farming at various state training facilities. He himself provides training to many aspiring mushroom cultivators.

Can Mushroom Cure Diseases?

In the year 2010, Sharma became the first farmer in India to have cultivated ganoderma mushrooms (Reishi mushrooms) and he was awarded for this achievement by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi. Talking about ganoderma mushrooms, Sharma reveals that there is no match to this mushroom variety and that it cannot be praised enough. Research has shown that this particular mushroom has anti-oxidant properties and complex sugars called beta-glucans. According to some lab studies, these compounds can help stop the spread and growth of cancer cells.

Sharma says that earning profit is never the main aim of a farmer; the lives of ‘annadatas’ are all about giving the world health and prosperity. He tells Krishi Jagran that there are many diseases for which there is no cure even in allopathic medicines. For such diseases, Sharma explains, nature has given human beings food substances like Cordyceps Militaris. He advises farmers to produce common mushrooms before stepping into the production of medicinal mushrooms.

5 Most Important Factors in Mushroom Cultivation

Sharma highlights five most important factors that play a huge role in successful mushroom cultivation:

Knowledge

To avoid getting duped by fraudsters, it is necessary for farmers to have the basic knowledge about mushroom cultivation along with proper professional training.

Spawns

Farmers should either make their own spawns or obtain it from a governmental research institute.

Timely Harvest

Harvesting the mushrooms in a timely manner is a very important step to ensure its quality.

Marketing

It is necessary to market mushrooms at the right time to prevent the stock from rotting.

Innovation

Sharma gives his own example to explain how mushrooms must be self-marketed. He talks about how his business in Rajasthan uses them to make health supplements which can be consumed by people of all ages.

A Message by Rajasthan’s Mushroom King

Sharma urges the young students of India to not just study for a salaried job but start a new venture of their own. He says that the future of mushroom cultivation in India is very bright and more and more farmers should try to build a fortune in it.",1
796803,How This Farmer Made a Fortune with Pearl Farming,"Narendra Garwa is a pearl farmer based in Rajasthan. He recently spoke to Krishi Jagran in the FTB Live session. Garwa has been practicing pearl farming for over seven years. Today, he has projects all over India and is trying to generate employment for all.

Garwa told our correspondent that he wanted to do something very different ever since his childhood. He initially used to be a book seller but his business went down. He then tried experimenting with growing vegetables on the rooftop. After attempting various ways to make a living, he learnt that pearl farming is now being done in India. He found out that the training for pearl farming was being provided to farmers at CIFA, Odisha. He got in touch with the scientists there and began his training. In 2015, he started his pearl farming business.

Secrets to Pearl Farming

In the initial days, Garwa faced many problems. He first bought 500 pearl shells from Kerala. However, this attempt proved to be a complete failure. He tried again and this time 300 of the 500 pearl shells he had bought survived. Slowly, he managed to keep the shells in less water and maintain pH balance. Soon, he was working on a huge profit.

Garwa also runs an NGO which provides training to aspiring pearl farmers. They also run another program which charges farmers 4,000 rupees for training, equipment, and any further help.

Going into the details of pearl agriculture, he explains how pearl farming is done. The pearl shell has a life cycle of 7-8 years. It yields pearls of different shapes; for instance, it would take 18 months to make a spherical pearl. It takes 12 months to make a non-spherical pearl. While Garwa produces both kinds of pearls, he insists that novice farmers initially produce non-spherical pearls as the mortality rate of spherical pearls is much higher and it takes a lot of experience to successfully produce them. He informs that the demand for non-spherical pearls is also high in the market. The cutting of non-spherical pearls is done by artisans and it only costs 50 Rupees per pearl.

Garwa also advises aspiring pearl farmers to start with a 10 × 30 feet pond layered with plastic sheet. He lays emphasis on the balance of ammonia content in the water. To achieve this, a water pump is introduced to the pond to keep the water fresh. The pH level should be 7-8. The pearl shells feed on algae and therefore it is necessary to maintain the pH of the water. If the shell is healthy, the pearl it produces would have a better shine.

A seed is implanted manually inside the shell and this seed is easily available in the market. He says that even if 500 pearl shells survive, a farmer can easily make 2-2.5 lakh rupees in a year. In fact, pearl agriculture is a highly profitable occupation and to increase its profitability, Garwa suggests farmers to practice it along with fish farming in the same pond. Another encouraging factor for farmers desirous of pearl farming is the fact that it does not require changing water in the pond many times. In a month, only 10-15% of the total water content in the pond needs to be changed.

In the beginning, Garwa faced a lot of problems with marketing the finished product as well. He didn’t have any understanding of where to sell it but slowly he learnt to make use of platforms like India Mart and Amazon. As his business grew, individuals and even companies started buying from him. Now, Garwa not only has an established business but he also provides training to aspiring farmers. Anybody interested in pearl agriculture could apply on their website www.alkhafoundation.com and they would be contacted by Garwa and his team. They help farmers from the beginning to the end of the process.

Imparting the Art of Pearl Farming

Alka Foundation is an NGO run by Garwa which helps farmers and women. They educate farmers all across the country about pearl farming and teach them how they can carry it alongside fish farming. Their aim, Garwa says, is to bring profit to the farmers. He says that implanting seed inside the pearl shell is an art and any wrong step in this can increase the chances of mortality of the shell. Garwa says that his foundation imparts this art to the farmers.

Garwa has received many district level awards and he was to be awarded by CIFA, Odisha as well. However, that got postponed due to the pandemic.",1
796817,Group farming can transform agriculture post - COVID-19,"Small and landless farmers are reviving group farming to combat the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Bina Agarwal, professor of development economics and environment at University of Manchester, UK, who has closely researched and documented group farming in the country for over a decade, talks about the concept of group farming, how it has evolved, its benefits and challenges.

You have researched group farming for over 10 years. What benefits can it bring?

Group farming involves the voluntarily pooling of land, labour and capital and cultivating in groups. This can help small farmers overcome their production constraints.

The majority of Indian farms are too small to be economically viable. Some 86 per cent of farmers cultivate under two hectares, in fragments. Most lack access to irrigation, bank credit, up-to-date technical information, new technologies, and bargaining power in markets. A large proportion are women. Group farming can provide an institutional solution.

By forming groups, farmers can enjoy economies of scale, have more investible funds and skills, reduce input costs, and take measures to address climate change. Women can transcend social norms that restrict their access to institutions and markets, and gain independent identities as farmers.

My research, which has also catalysed new experiments in India and Nepal, demonstrates this. I am researching group farming in Europe as well.

In some states farmers collectively hire machines since it is economical, although they cultivate individually. Would you call this group farming?

No, that constitutes a much lower level of cooperation. Cooperation can be at different levels. At the lowest level you can have ‘single-purpose cooperation’, such as joint marketing of produce (Amul is an example), or collectively buying irrigation equipment, or hiring machines together.

Next comes ‘medium-level multipurpose cooperation’, such as joint crop planning across ecological zones, or pooling labour for creating rainwater harvesting systems.

But these farmers still cultivate individually. Group farming requires what I call ‘fully integrated cooperation’, with farmers pooling land, labour, capital and skills to cultivate together and sharing costs and returns. This can bring the most economic benefit.

Can group farming be done only on owned land?

It can be done on either owned or leased land, or a combination of both. In Kerala, group farming is based largely on land leasing. Here the state government began promoting all-women group farms in the early 2000s, under its poverty-eradication mission, Kudumbasharee. Today there are over 68,000 such farms.

In Telangana, a smaller experiment to form 500 group farms was tried by the United Nations Development Programme in 2021, collaboratively with the central government, and implemented by a quasi-non-government (NGO) organisation, The Andhra Pradesh Mahila Samatha Society (APMSS). Here too, all-women groups depended largely on leased land, since few women own land.

In Bihar and north Bengal, however, where you also find all-male and mixed-gender groups, men often pool their own land.

You did rigorous research in Kerala and Telangana. How did you collect the data and what did you find?

I organised and supervised a research team to meticulously collect weekly data for every input and output, for each crop and plot, for an entire year in 2012-13. The data we collected related to a sample of 250 group and individual farms in two districts of Kerala and 763 farms of both types in three districts of Telangana. In addition, we conducted focused group discussions to collect qualitative data on group histories and functioning.

My analysis showed that Kerala’s group farms achieved 1.8 times the annual value of output per hectare and five times the net returns per farm relative to the sampled individual family farms (95 per cent of which were male managed).

In Telangana, however, the group farms did worse than individual farms in terms of productivity, but equally well on net returns, since they saved on hired labour.

In both states, however, group farming empowered women socially and politically.

Why did Kerala perform better than Telangana?

Several factors underlie their divergent performance. In Kerala the groups received technical training and performance incentives from the Kudumbashree Mission. They were connected through independently registered Community Development Societies (CDS), which were formed at the Panchayat-level, with elected representatives from women group farmers at the ward level and ward-level representatives in the CDS.

These societies gave the group farms overall support and local negotiating power. The small groups of five to six members are appropriate for cooperation and for getting subsidised credit from NABARD. The members are literate; caste-heterogeneity enlarges their social networks and access to leased land; and commercial cropping improves profits. All this enabled the groups to overcome many of the resource constraints that women farmers normally face, and created a more gender-equal playing field.

In contrast, Telangana’s groups lacked state support after the UNDP project ended in 2005, although institutional support from APMSS continued. The groups were too large (22 members on average) and most members were scheduled caste, which narrowed their social reach and land access. A focus on foodgrains without much irrigation led to low yields. Basically, Telangana added group farming to a pre-existing programme for social empowerment while Kerala specifically designed theirs for livelihood enhancement.

The two states provide lessons on both what to do and what not to do when attempting replication elsewhere.

In one district of Telangana, some still-active groups now have 10 women per group, as you had recommended. Can this improve women’s income?

Small group size will increase their per capita returns and make labour coordination among the members easier. However, to perform better they also need technical support from the state government, more heterogeneity among group members, a diverse crop mix that includes commercial crops, and an institutional spine which links the groups, like the CDS in Kerala.

You also mentioned group farming in Bihar and Bengal. How did they perform?

Here group formation was notably influenced by my writings, and the principles I had enunciated helped shape institutional design from the start. In these states, exciting new models have emerged with varying gender composition, including all-women groups, mixed-gender groups and all-male groups. Some pool-owned land, others lease in land together, or both. Also some cultivate collectively for the whole year, others for one season or crop. The farmers pool contiguous plots which enables efficient irrigation.

All the collectives report higher wheat and rice yields than they had achieved as individual farmers. Those leasing land in Bihar have been able to negotiate lower rents and refuse to provide unpaid labour to powerful landlords. That group farming can work in feudal contexts is very encouraging and demonstrates the replicability of the basic model.

Did group farming help farmers during the COVID lockdown?

Yes it did. From all the evidence I garnered in May-June of 2020, it made a big difference, especially by helping small farmers survive during the COVID-19 national lockdown. In Kerala, the evidence showed that of the over 30,000 all-women group farms cultivating in March 2020, some 87 per cent survived economically. They were able to sell their produce locally and to the community kitchens being run by Kudumbashree women. This especially helped them market their perishable fruits and vegetables. In contrast many individual male farmers suffered losses.

In Gujarat, where 16 all-women group farms had been formed after I conducted a workshop there in August 2018, NGO Cohesion — catalysed the groups — reported that all the women were food secure. In contrast, individual farmers lost out due to shortages of harvest labour and sale bottlenecks.

Similarly, the Bihar farmers’ collectives reported that their high wheat yields provided them enough grains for subsistence needs, at a time when the government’s public distribution system (on which most marginal farmers depended) proved unreliable.

How can group farming model be replicated more widely?

Farmers need technical support and production incentives from the government, and, at least initially, a local NGO to guide them and help them gain experience with this new form of functioning.

The institutional design should also be thought through carefully, such as keeping the groups small, allowing some social heterogeneity of caste and religion among members, and connecting the groups in a federated structure, like Kerala did in creating the CDS. The crops grown should also suit local ecology and demand, and include commercial crops. This will enhance productivity and profits.

How do farmer producer organisations (FPOs) differ from group farms?

Mainly FPOs jointly market output and sometimes bulk input purchase. They rarely undertake joint cultivation, with farmers pooling land and labour. And there are only about 6,000 FPOs, many of which exist only in name. Group farmers, as I had mentioned, actually cultivate together.

However, group farms and FPOs could serve complementary functions. Clusters of group farms could register as an FPO for purchasing inputs and selling surplus output. But FPOs alone cannot help small and marginal farmers solve their production problems, or produce enough surplus to benefit from forming an FPO.

Why is the government reluctant to promote group farming?

First, it is preoccupied with agricultural marketing, paying little attention to the production constraints that small farmers face, or to the institutional innovations needed. Second, there is scepticism due to failed experiments in group farming in the 1960s, without analysing why those failed.

Basically, the government had promoted a flawed model, pushing small and large farmers to cooperate without recognising conflicts of interest between them. There was also little understanding of institutional design.

Today’s group farming programmes have adapted the successful self-help group model, which has worked for savings and credit. This model is based on principles of voluntariness, small group size, participatory decision-making and egalitarian relationships.

I believe that if the government were to seriously support group farming, it could institutionally transform Indian agriculture and farmers’ livelihoods.",1
796860,Indian farmers can take on the multinationals,"Sharad Joshi, the well-known, controversial farm leader from Maharashtra, outlines a new strategy for agriculture.

AT A RALLY of 300,000 people in Shegaon, Maharashtra, last November, the Shetkari Sanghatana put forward a new farm programme called chaturang sheti (four-pronged agriculture). Sanghatana leader Sharad Joshi argued the economic crises and the collapse of statist development models have resulted in the state being unable to extract surpluses for industrial development at the expense of agriculture. Welcoming liberalisation as a lifting of government restrictions, Joshi insists farmers can face competition in the world market. Chaturang sheti ranges from farming for export to Sita sheti (Sita farming), which envisions women farming small plots for household consumption.

Doesn't the programme you gave for Sita sheti at Shegaon sound suspiciously like natural farming?

Why do you use the term ""suspiciously""? If the two are similar, that is a happy thing. However, any suspicions are that the two programmes, Sita sheti and organic farming, are only superficially similar. It is a fact that people all over Maharashtra and India are working for organic agriculture. We are happy about this, but there are important differences between organic agriculture and Sita farming.



While both agree that a shift away from the Green Revolution (GR) package is desirable, there is a difference in emphasis. We are neither champions nor antagonists of the GR package. In fact, we are apologists for it in the sense that we believe that in the 1960s there was no alternative. Without it there would have been massive starvation. But that period is over and we have attained some sort of food self-sufficiency.



Now, the question is: In what direction do we move? Many are talking today of replicating Punjab's Green Revolution in the eastern region, but we feel we must innovate and discover a new technology and package.



What is ""Sita farming""?

It is essentially an open-door research programme, which is entrusted to women. GR was brought in through labs supported by the government. The approach we took is that the work will be done by women, who are most interested.



We want women to experiment on their own small plots and exchange information among themselves about the rational way of production. Our approach would not necessarily be organic. There will be an investigation of all kinds of products and practices for the improvement of the produce. I think, ultimately, we'll have to evolve a rational scientific mixture of the various categories of inputs.



Why is Sita farming particularly for women?

In the search for an alternative package, a basic change in paradigm is involved and I have a feeling that most men have somehow been brainwashed into full involvement with either chemical or organic agriculture. For women, the new role will bring in a degree of confidence.



Sita has been the traditional name for the goddess, as daughter of the earth, and in the Ramayana there are many references to Sita's role. Her life, her fate, her misery, her tragedy have all become a central motif of the rural women's movement led by Shetkari Mahila Aghadi.





There has been a spontaneous evolution of idiom rather than any calculation. We found that the reaction that men and women gave to the travails of Sita was a force in itself. We are not like Marxists who don't touch anything that comes from tradition. If it's called ""Lenin sheti"", would it be good?



Why is Shetkari Sanghatana taking up this issue just now?

In the collapse of the Nehruvian model, we've achieved the goal we set ourselves a decade earlier. Agriculture is on the threshold of being recognised as a vocation, rather than a lifestyle. We've accomplished a lot in 10 years, not only with regard to remunerative prices, but also in women's rights and organic farming.



Would you say that the extreme centralisation of capital accumulation in the process of capitalism and colonialism is mainly responsible for environmental destruction?

I have one rider. There are imbalances within the Third World countries also. A number of people who claim to be champions of the Third World today are really champions of the ""Indias"" within the Third World. There is no homogeneity of interest even with regard to the environment here.



But why are all these new developments in the farmers' movement and environment movement taking place now?

The historic world defeat of a system that was supposed to be the only alternative to capitalism is one factor. The economic crunch faced by the Third World neo-colonial states is another. It is understandable that the long-subjugated, real producers try to take up some programmes like the Shegaon one. Environmentalists are largely disillusioned socialists in search of an argument that would justify statist intervention, now that Marxist economics has failed.



Possibly, something more fundamental is happening below the surface.

I am talking of those who are trying to move backwards to the old agriculture and those who are trying to mobilise farmer support against the Dunkel draft by creating imaginary phantoms. They know little of agriculture and less of agricultural developments.



Aren't these stirrings among peasants in many countries in the world, in many ways, a basis?

You are out to find similarities that don't exist. And, you are out to find differences. Well, let's talk of other aspects of chaturang sheti.



Why is processing (mazghar sheti) important and is it also connected with women?

At the present stage, yes. Agroprocessing is a very important part of the alternative pattern. While export and commerce of value-added agricultural produce is important, the Alfa-Laval method of value-adding is proving to be very expensive for the farmer as the entire benefit goes to the technology vendor and the subsidy dispenser. Therefore, we have thought of a different pattern of agroprocessing, where the product is not of western style, but of Indian origin. There, we feel nobody can compete with us. And, we do that with our own technology, respecting, of course, standards of hygiene.



But aren't multinationals in the agricultural sector trying to limit the farmer to cultivating the crop? Won't you have to fight the multinationals?

I have to fight with them, but fight with them economically. And, I'm very confident that the Indian farmer with his mazghar sheti can countenance all the competition from the multinationals. There are certain areas we can't compete in and there are certain areas they can't compete in. But we would like to one day get to the position where they are today.



What gives you this confidence?

India's position should be not to introduce artificial restrictions, but to create a situation where the introduction of subsidies and restrictions on the lines of the European Economic Community would become less and less practicable. We have to be advocating more free marketing because it's in our interests. We can sell wheat right now at Rs 300 when nobody in the world can sell it for less than Rs 600. That's the advantage we have.



Many feel it is wrong to talk of exporting food when so many are undernourished in India.

We've had undernourishment because exports are banned. If we had that kind of market availability, production would have spurted. Exports have not caused malnourishment. It's the other way around.



Do you want to remain only primary producers?

I think there are regions on the earth that are more conducive to production of biomass and there are regions that are less so. It would be wrong for a country in the tropics to produce something that is more appropriate, say, to the Scandinavian countries. You ask if some countries are always to remain primary producers? Yes, as long as the terms of trade allow biomass producers to live with the same dignity and with the same standard of living as industrial producers.



Why do you talk of vyapari sheti or commercial agriculture?

It's not commercial agriculture, it's normal agriculture. What we are proposing right now is something that is very common in all industrial societies, chain store networks and retail outlets, all of which are totally absent here. We are proposing a structure that combines farmers and consumers.



So, while almost all environmentalists and left organisations have condemned the New Economic Policy, you welcome it.

Yes. Those who can compete if trade barriers, subsidies and production restrictions are dropped, will welcome liberalisation. The Indian industrial system cannot survive without subsidies; the Bharat farmer can. Therefore, we welcome liberalisation. We only ask that the government not limit liberalisation to industry but extend it to agriculture also, so that farmers are allowed full rights to produce, to process and to sell without restriction. We also ask that the government use all its strength in favour of abolition of subsidies and lowering of trade barriers that are used at present to shore up US and European inefficiencies. As the Dunkel Draft includes primarily a programme for a phased dropping of restrictions and subsidies, we support it. We are not afraid of patents. We will patent our own seeds and crop varieties that farmers have developed over the centuries. Farmers can face the challenge of the multinationals, only if our own government does not come in the way.",1

797983,Doubling Farmers Income: Complete Guide & Action Plan for Farmers to Increase Their Income,"Doubling Farmers Income has been a topic of discussion for quite some time now. Farmers who play a vital role in the Indian economy are mostly not aware of this Central Government strategy of doubling farmer’s income by the financial year 2022-23. In this guide, we will explain to you what is Doubling Farmers Income, Why it is important, How can we double the income of farmers, and much more beneficial information for our farmers.

What is Doubling Farmers Income?

In simple words, Doubling Farmers Income is a central government strategy to help the farmers by doubling their income by 2022-23. The plan has recognized the need to raise farmer’s income as a direct measure to promote farmers' welfare. Doubling Farmers Income can directly have a positive effect on the future of agriculture.

Why Doubling Farmers Income is important?

If the income earned by the farmer is doubled then he/she will use better farm machinery, better and advanced technologies for farming to increase productivity, better quality of seeds, etc. Therefore, increasing farmer’s income means increasing agricultural productivity. Doubling Farmers Income will not only increase agriculture production by using better farming techniques but also improve the quality of crops. Both the quantity and quality of food can be achieved by Doubling Farmers Income. It will lead to the growth of the Indian economy. Incident of farmer’s suicide will come to an end if farmers are financially satisfied.

How can we double the income of farmers?

Strong measures are required to fulfill the aim of doubling the income of farmers.

The following measure can be taken within the agriculture sector to double farmer’s income:

Improvement in productivity

Saving in cost of production

Cropping intensity must be increased

There must be diversification towards high-value crops

Action plan to double farmers income outside the agriculture sector include:

Plan to shift cultivators from farm to non-farm occupations

There must be an improvement in terms of trade for farmers or real prices received by farmers

What is the Strategy for Improving Farmers Income?

Farmers must adopt these strategies to improve their income

Development initiatives like infrastructure

Better Technology

Awareness and implementation of Policies

Institutional mechanisms

798489,Eleven new and improved rice varieties released in Burundi,"Share this

19 August 2022, Philippines: Recently, the Institut des Sciences Agronomiques du Burundi (ISABU) released eleven new and improved rice varieties that are resilient to climate change, disease-tolerant, high yielding with great nutritional value, and with good grain quality.

These rice varieties were released in collaboration with the International Rice Research Institute-Burundi under World Bank’s variety development program through the Great Lakes Regional Integrated Agriculture Development Project (Projet Régional de Développement Agricole Intégré dans les Grands Lacs or PRDAIGL).

On July 26, 2022, the members of the governing agency for seed chain in Burundi such as the CTNHV (Commission Technique Nationale d’Homologation Variétale “National Technical Committee for Variety release”) met in Bujumbura to analyze the results of the Distinctive Homogeneity Stability and Agronomic and Technological Value trials presented by the Burundian authority for responsible for seed control and certification, Office National de Control et de Certification des Semences (ONCCS).

The eleven released varieties include two (2) high-zinc rice varieties, two (2) aromatic supa type varieties, three (3) high-yielding long rain varieties, three (3) drought-tolerant varieties, and one (1) variety tolerant to rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV), an endemic virus affecting many African rice-cultivating areas.

These new rice varieties will be a crucial addition to the Burundi farmers’ cropping system that relies on local cultivars.

“The released aromatic varieties once grown by farmers at high scale will reduce the volume of imported aromatic rice from Tanzania and help the country save currencies needed for importation. On the other hand, the RYMV-resistant varieties will be grown to replace the RYMV-susceptible varieties in the Western and Eastern part of the country. As for zinc biofortified lines, they will add nutritional value and help kids’ growth in the families where rice is the main source of food,” said Julie Nduwimana, a researcher at IRRI Burundi.

The new rice varieties will be registered to the national catalog of species and varieties cultivated in Burundi. Local farmers can participate in the nomination of each variety by giving them local names.

Moving forward, ISABU will provide breeder seeds to individuals or groups of farmers who intend to produce basic seeds each season. Commercial seeds will also be multiplied by producers who eventually will sell them to farmers.

Guest Author: Dr. Suseelendra Desai, Dean of School of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, NMIMS Shirpur

09 August 2022, New Delhi: The industrial revolution provided many chemicals for enhanced farm productivity to meet global food demands. However, their misuse and abuse adversely impacted the ecological balance leading to grave concerns about human health and welfare of the animals and workers.

Dr. Suseelendra Desai, Dean of School of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, NMIMS Shirpur

According to the FAO of the UN, GAP is a science-driven application of available knowledge to address environmental, economic, and social sustainability aspects of on-farm and post-production processes for safe and healthy agricultural products. GAP targets the quality and safety of the food consumed, health and welfare of the workers’ and animals; socio-economics and ecological balance. The four pillars of GAP are Food quality and safety; Economic viability; Environmental stability; and Social acceptability.

The important elements of GAP are i) critical control points; ii) risk assessment; iii) traceability; iv) documentation and record-keeping; v) communication continuity and stakeholder awareness building; vi) regular monitoring of pre-production, production and post-production activities; vii) worker and animal health and safety; viii) independent third party audits; ix) oversight and enforcement and x) environment issues.

History & Spread of GAP

To address the rising concerns about the food-related quality and safety, British retailers started a network ‘Euro-Retailer Produce Working Group’ in 1997 and came up with EurepGAP to set standards for the certification of agricultural products. It is a private B2B setup to certify different agricultural commodities produced. The GAP standards include use of certified inputs; all the farming activities during and post-production.

The certification is carried out by independent and accredited bodies spread across the world through rigorous scheduled and unscheduled inspections and documentation. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CODEX) is the international food standards setting body of the FAO and WHO. It develops international food standards, guidelines and codes of practice for an international food code that contributes to the safety, quality and fairness of food trade.

Successful execution of EurepGAP as a harmonized certification and spread beyond Europe prompted its renaming as GlobalGAP in 2007. Currently producers across 134 countries are registered with GlobalGAP. This success prompted food industries, producer organizations and even Governments to develop regional GAPs for a range of commodities such as ASEAN GAP, SAARC GAP and national GAPs such as USDA GAP & GHP, Japan (JGAP), Thailand (ThaiGAP), and Malaysia (MyGAP), Indonesia (IndoGAP), Taiwan (TGAP), India (IndGAP), ChinaGAP, Vietnam (VietGAP), the Philippines (PhilGAP), etc.

IndGAP

IndGAP was developed in line with the GlobalGAP to cover all agricultural farm produce and agro-biodiversity. It focuses on the quality and quantity of the produce, pre and post-harvest practices including worker’s safety, promote eco-friendly farming practices, safe and sustained supply of produce and develop niche markets. An IndGAP license may be obtained by individuals or groups of producers. Three types of GAP licenses are awarded based on compliance of major and minor requirements.

Current limitations of GAP

The concept of GAP needs a thorough understanding of the GAP requirements vis-à-vis food safety and quality. However, due to the large extent of illiteracy, most of the farmers are unaware of the safety, environmental and social impacts of the agricultural practices followed by them.

The other limitations include lack of incentives and motivation; poorly-regulated marketing system with no direct links with markets; absence of farmer networks; unhygienic production and processing practices; shortage of skilled labour; lack of communication and coordination of the producer-processor-policy maker- extension agency chain; and inappropriate use of chemicals.

Often farmers feel that GAP implementation, especially record keeping and certification will increase production costs. GAP can also alter the supplier-buyer relations through competing interests of specific stakeholders. Poor hand-holding of the small holder heterogeneity is leading to losing international markets. The monsoon dependence of Indian agriculture might result in long-term compliance barriers.

The way forward

System approach vs commodity approach: Indian agriculture spreads across 127 diverse agroecologies with ample scope for sustainable livelihoods by implementing GAP. GAPs may be applied to a wide range of farming systems and at different scales. However, most of the GAPs are commodity-oriented while agriculture and allied sectors are system-oriented. A systems approach in GAP will help to minimize the documentation & audit costs and enhance profitability.

Dynamic updation of GAPs: Currently, GAPs are updated only on need basis. There should be a mechanism to incorporate new science into GAPs to make them dynamic. The research organizations and institutions of higher learning should be networked in each agro-ecology for this purpose.

Incentivizing the GAP stakeholders: Providing incentives to the farmers adopting GAP will motivate others to join the same. For instance, USDA covers costs for GAP audits up to USD 2000. In India, certification services are provided for organic production. However, similar services could be extended for GAP audits and certification.

Awareness building and networking of farmers: The extension agencies must handhold the stakeholders for smooth implementation of GAP. Like in the USA, integration of GAP and GHP for the production systems will increase food safety, economic viability, and reduce costs of certification. As 85% of the farmers are small and marginal, networking them into natural groups like SHGs to reduce costs of certification and ensure assured supply.

Promotion of FPCs supported by cost accountants and business managers is essential as farmers are often good at only production chain management. Imparting new knowledge is key for success of GAP implementation. The NeGP mission mode project service 3 of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India envisages to provide information on GAP using ICT and farm advisory services. This project involves 21 Central agencies, 10 state level agencies, 3 district level bogies and 6 NGO level agencies. When implemented as envisaged, the project will have all necessary set up and information for GAP.

Standards for microbial hazards: Microbiological hazards associated with food production and distribution is a major concern and calls for vulnerability based standard setting to ensure safety. Food Safety and Standards Authority of India can be an active player as it is the nodal agency to develop safety standards for microbiological hazards in the food chain.

Research support: Scientifically-sound GAPs could be timely and beneficial when they are backstopped by research programmes. HACCP-based specific research programmes have to be supported by the public and private bodies to generate viable solutions. Funding to maintain common databases on integrated production techniques for each of the major agro-ecologies will help to collect, analyse and disseminate information of good practices in relevant geographical contexts.",1
798505,Agri-tech platform WayCool creates 7500+ sqft Indian tricolor with fresh vegetables,"Share this

17 August 2022, Bengaluru: In commemoration of the 75th Independence Day of India – Azaadi ka Amrit Mahotsav, WayCool Foods created a first-of-its-kind food flag installation spread approx 7632 sq.ft near its Distribution Centre at Kannamangala, Bangalore.

The food flag was symbolic of India’s successful transformation from a food scarce to a food surplus nation and a journey to become a food powerhouse for the world. It is also one of the largest producers of fruits and vegetables in the world. The fruits and vegetables being used in the creation of the flag were distributed to The Akshaya Patra Foundation immediately after the event.

A refreshing take on the Har Ghar Tiranga Campaign, WayCool successfully recreated the tri-colors of the flag with a fine selection of grown-in-india fresh produce like carrots, radishes, green okra, beans, capsicum, as well as value added products such as Potato flakes, and more. Over 20 tonnes and various varieties of fresh produce were used, this showcasing India’s incredible versatility and diversity of agricultural output. The saffron was represented by carrots, radishes and potato flakes forming the white & the flag was given a magnificent finish of green with capsicum, beans and ladies finger (green okra).

The company also used its storage and handling technologies to ensure that not a single gram of the produce used in the display was wasted, and the produce was handled with the best hygiene practices. The produce was then donated to Akshaya Patra Foundation. One of the largest Food Flags created, the company also ensured that it fed the needy with near to zero food wastage.

WayCool Foods is food and agri-tech platform focusing on food development and distribution. The company leverages innovative technology to scale and operate a complex supply chain from soil to sale. Through its farmer engagement program – Outgrow, the company works closely with 150k farmers.",1
798512,"Will picket your stores in winter, Himachal apple growers threaten Adani AgroFresh","Apple growers are unhappy over Adani Agrofresh setting arbitrary prices of apples, which has led to market fluctuation

Apple growers in Himachal Pradesh August 25, 2022 gave an ultimatum to Adani AgroFresh to revise its rates for procuring the fruits in a week’s time. The farmers would picket Adani stores during winter if their demands are not complied with, Sanjay Chauhan, a leader of the cultivators, told this reporter.

The growers had gheraoed Adani AgroFresh’s stores at three locations in Shimla namely Dahali, Bithal and Sainj August 25

The farmers, led by the Sanyukt Kisan Manch, comprising 30 organisations associated with apple horticulture, had planned the gherao after Adani AgroFresh recently announced the prices of apple procurement.

The announcement took place on the day when a high power government committee was formed to fix the prices of apples.

The committee had been formed after growers had gheraoed the state Secretariat to protest against Goods and Service Tax rates and hike in the prices of packaging material. After this, the farmers had organised a jail bharo movement.

Harish Chauhan, president of the Sanyukt Kisan Manch, told this reporter that the company was misleading horticulturists and the government.

He said Adani Agrofresh was one of the largest buyers of apples in Himachal Pradesh and the prices fixed by it would have a profound impact on market prices. Top Adani officials also did not attend the meeting called by the committee August 23.

Prashant Sehata, general secretary of the Young and United Progressive Association, told this reporter that Adani AgroFresh bought fruits at different rates by dividing them into several grades according to their colour and size.

This time too, Adani AgroFresh has set a target of procuring around 25,000 metric tonnes of apples from apple growers in Himachal Pradesh.

Sehata said Adani AgroFresh’s opening rates for apples this year were 12-15 per cent less than last year. Last year, the company had kept the maximum price at Rs 85 per kg, while this time the rate is Rs 76. This, even as the cost of apple production has increased by more than 30 per cent, compared to last year.

He added that the company should have increased the rate of apples on the same lines.

The farmers have noted that this year’s crop has fruits of smaller size which are less colourful. In such a situation, Adani, which buys apples on the basis of colour is sure to get a lower price.

“A 25 kg box of apples that are more or less colourful, is being sold in large to small sizes at rates ranging from Rs 1,700-2,300. The average price of this comes to Rs 68-92.

Even if the cost of packing is excluded, the average rate gets to Rs 62-85. On this basis, if we take the average rate of Adani AgroFresh, it comes to around Rs 60-70 in both grades,” Sehata said.

Ashutosh Chauhan, an apple grower from Ratnadi, an apple-growing area, said Adani AgroFresh’s opening rate has had a very bad effect on the market.

“As soon as the company opened rates August 13 this time, apple prices fell by Rs 400-500 in the market the next day. While last year, this decline was up to Rs 1,000,” Chauhan said.

He said there should be uniformity in the prices of apples and arbitrary prices being fixed by private companies should be regulated by the government.

The meeting of the high power committee headed by the vice-chancellor of Nauni University was held August 23 to decide the prices of apples. Representatives of eight big procurers of apples had been called, but only eight attended.

Sanjay Chauhan, co-convenor of the Sanyukt Kisan Manch, said the companies do not take the instructions of the committee and government seriously. Therefore, representatives of most companies did not attend.

“During the meeting, when the agreements and terms and conditions signed with big companies like Adani were sought, neither the government nor the companies showed any memorandum of understanding,” he said.

Chauhan added that the companies are doing as they please due to a lack of any rules and regulations. “Now, we will not accept the whims of the companies and will intensify our movement further,” he said.

Rajeshwar Singh Chandel, chairman of the committee formed to fix the price of apples, said the companies who did not come to the meeting, would be asked to respond.

Apart from this, Adani AgroFresh will also be asked to respond about apple rates. Apart from this, the demands of the farmers are being considered by the committee.",1
798539,Four successful years of research on alternatives to contentious inputs in organic farming,"Share this

26 August 2022, Switzerland: The aim of the project RELACS (Replacement of Contentious Inputs in Organic Farming Systems) was to develop and validate alternatives to contentious inputs in organic crop production (copper, mineral oils, nutrient inputs) and livestock production (anthelmintics, antibiotics and synthetic vitamins) and to propose implementation roadmaps. Starting from a list of alternatives at various technology maturity levels, project coordinator Lucius Tamm of FiBL Switzerland states that many technologies have reached the final stages necessary for on-farm implementation. For a rapid adoption by farmers, policy support at various levels and smart roadmaps are needed.

Copper alternatives

Four alternative products for copper achieved advanced Technology Readiness Levels* (TRL higher than 7). These alternative products can be used in grapevine, apple and other horticultural crops. The pilot products provided promising protection levels in a wide range of crops and pedo-climatic conditions – either as a stand-alone application or in strategies combining the alternatives with low copper doses. It will be possible to reduce copper use on grapevine and apple in the next decade, provided the alternatives can be authorised. The EU should also adapt the registration process to plant-based products, which is currently very lengthy and time-consuming. However, the supply of sufficient quantities of alternatives at an economically feasible price remains an extraordinary challenge. RELACS, therefore, advises pursuing a minimisation strategy rather than full replacement of copper. Such a minimisation strategy could consist of the cultivation of resistant varieties or the implementation of preventive measures (e. g. enhanced functional biodiversity, crop management practices), the use of alternative substances and Decision Support Systems (DSS) that allow lowering application rates.

Alternative to replace mineral (paraffin) oil

In citrus production, two alternative products were tested to replace mineral (paraffin) oil against pests such as scales, thrips and mites. Furthermore, progress was made in the development of vibrational disruption that mimics the acoustic communication signals specific to the pest to thus disturb the mating behaviour and reproduction of the pest insect. A substantial reduction of mineral oil, using less problematic products and innovative techniques, seems feasible in the near future. The mineral oil reduction strategy should include measures to enhance biodiversity, the use of alternative products based on plant extracts (Clitoria ternatea and orange essential oil) and the use of vibrational signals. Both mineral oil and copper alternatives suffer from complicated approval procedures.

Anthelmintic alternatives

Two alternatives to anthelmintics – a group of antiparasitic drugs that expel parasitic worms (helminths) and other internal parasites – were tested in RELACS: biocontrol products based on Duddingtonia flagrans and the feeding of tannin-rich fodder such as heather. They can reduce overall anthelmintic use by 30 to 50 percent in organic cattle, sheep and goats. The alternatives provide complementary control strategies to reduce but not replace anthelmintics. Involving vets and adapting registration procedures for veterinary medicines based on natural substances will be key to ensuring acceptability and rapid adoption of the alternatives.

Reducing antibiotics

Two alternative strategies to reduce antibiotic use in organic dairy cows were explored: An Animal Health and Welfare Planning Protocol (AHWP) combining detailed farm-specific data with Farmer Field Schools (and the use of essential oils to control light to moderate mastitis). FFS are meetings where several farmers share advice peer-to-peer on specific problems of the hosting farmers, following an established meeting protocol. Both approaches are promising for the reduction of antibiotics as no difference in (mild or moderate) clinical mastitis cure between essential oil and antibiotic treatment was observed, nor were any negative impacts on milk quality or animal health and welfare observed. Proper implementation of the Animal Health and Welfare Planning Protocol has a very high potential – of up to 50 % – to reduce antibiotic use for mastitis treatments in dairy cattle. However, it is necessary to strongly invest in advisory services and involve vets to facilitate its adoption. In the medium term, antibiotic reduction strategies could be complemented by the use of essential oils, although research needs to confirm this. The EU should also adapt the authorisation process to herbal veterinary products, which is currently very lengthy and time-consuming.

Vitamin supplements

Current supplementation levels of vitamin E and other vitamins in organic ruminants and B2/B12 vitamins in organic poultry can be substantially reduced since reduced vitamin diets had no negative impact on animals nor on milk or meat quality in our trials. A complete phase-out is not possible, but it should be possible to reduce vitamin E for organic dairy cows by approximately 50 % and vitamin B2 for organic poultry by 30 to 50 %. These reductions can take place in the very short term as there are no technical constraints for the feed industry. The identification of a GMO-free yeast strain overproducing riboflavin (vitamin B2) opens up an option for an additional alternative GMO-free and non-synthetic production. Currently, the situation is precarious as only one European supplier offers vitamin B2 produced without the help of GMOs. Therefore, it is essential to further develop the market and stimulate competition to avoid any shortage in vitamin B2. The European Commission is encouraged to take a clear decision on the regulatory status of products consisting of vitamin B2 produced without the help of GMOs, and it will need to adapt its registration of feed additives at the EU level to facilitate access to alternatives.

External nutrient inputs

The current use of and need for external nutrient inputs on organic farms in Europe was evaluated in eight case study regions. In many areas, additional nitrogen (N) inputs to organic agriculture are needed to increase productivity, while inputs of phosphate (P) and potassium (K) are required to prevent soil mining. The data produced in RELACS show that the importance of nutrient supply in organic farming has been underestimated so far. Limited availability of soil fertility inputs is the single most limiting factor for yields in stockless organic farms. Furthermore, a lack of cost-efficient supply of plant nutrients prevents upscaling of organic plant production beyond 15 to 20 % in many regions. Reducing the dependence of organic farms on conventional manure and external nutrients from non-renewable sources is nevertheless possible in the medium term by recycling societal waste streams. It is crucial that the safety and acceptability of these products are guaranteed and that the organic sector agrees on criteria for their use.

Feasible and cost-effective solutions identified

The conclusions of the RELACS project were developed through a series of national and European workshops with researchers, policymakers, industry, and farmer associations. The three roadmaps for reducing contentious plant protection products (copper, mineral oil), phasing-in new nutrient sources, and reducing contentious inputs used in livestock production (antibiotics, anthelmintics, vitamins) that resulted from them are available on the RELACS website (see link below)

The objectives of the European “Farm to Fork Strategy” add the necessity not only to replace problematic practices but also to provide widely accessible and cost-efficient alternatives in sufficient quantities. While the tools and technologies explored in RELACS fulfilled the expectations to a large extent with respect to efficacy, we also encountered major challenges concerning the duration until alternatives may be used legally by farmers (i. e. authorisation of inputs). Furthermore, many alternatives will be more expensive than the standard options, thus necessitating policy support as well as instruction and training to be adopted by farmers.

Conclusion

RELACS provided the scientific information needed to identify feasible and cost-effective solutions and the way forward to implementation, but it also identified bottlenecks at various levels along the value chain. It has also become clear that relevant EU policies will need to be tailor-made to address the various issues, depending on the specific input. Roadmaps were developed for fair, reliable, and implementable rules for contentious inputs addressed in the project. As expected, immediate phasing out of the contentious input would create unbearable risks and costs to the organic sector. In contrast, a smart roadmap with tiered transition phases may lead to a rapid and successful change of agricultural practice. It is/was essential to involve all relevant stakeholders to reach joint conclusions regarding the technical feasibility of solutions in the various pedo-climatic and socio-cultural situations of Europe.

798673,Sugar output up 20% till February: ISMA,"Share this

04 March 2021, New Delhi, IN: Sugar mills (502) across in the country have produced 233.77 lakh tonne of sugar till February 28, 2021, compared to 194.82 lakh tonne by 453 mills in the same period last season, showing an increase of nearly 20%.

The increase has mainly been driven by Maharashtra’s stunning 67% increase in production over last year. Its 188 sugar mills produced 84.85 lakh tonne of sugar in the 2020-21 season, compared to 50.70 lakh tonne produced by 145 mills in the corresponding period last year.According to a release by industry body ISMA, Uttar Pradesh, on the other hand, clocked lower sugar output at 74.20 lakh tonne till February of this marketing year, compared with 76.86 lakh tonne in the previous year.

Moreover, as many as 98 sugar mills across the country ended their operations by February 28, 2021. Last year, 70 sugar mills had closed their crushing operations as on February 29. Of the closed mills, 12 ended crushing in Maharashtra due to non-availability of cane in their area, most of them in the Solapur region, while 11 mills have stopped their crushing operations in UP, most of them in the eastern region. In Karnataka, 52 mills have already ended their crushing.

Raising concern over ex-mill prices of sugar showing a downward trend in most of the states, ISMA said average prices in Tamil Nadu are hovering between Rs 3,200 and Rs 3,225 per quintal, while in northern states, it is in the range of Rs 3,160–3,180 per quintal.

“The current prices are almost Rs 80-100 per quintal less than that what was prevailing a year back during the corresponding period… and this is not a good sign,” it said, adding that low sugar prices, much below the cost of production for last several months, have adversely affected the liquidity of mills and their ability to pay the FRP to cane farmers. “It is feared that if such situation persists, cane price arrears will jump very fast to uncomfortable levels.”

ISMA recommended an upward revision of sugar MSP, which was last revised two years back when the FRP of sugarcane was at Rs 275 per quintal. “Since the government has already increased the FRP of sugarcane by Rs 10 per quintal for the current year, there is a need to increase the MSP of sugar to Rs 34.50 per kg after considering the increased FRP of sugarcane for 2020-21. There is need to quickly decide on increasing the MSP of sugar to ensure that sugar mills are able to pay to farmers on time,” the association said.

798746,Urban agriculture: Towards an inclusive approach to make Delhi an ‘edible city’,"Much of urban farming in Delhi either a livelihood strategy or means of self-supply of organic vegetables

Urban agriculture can address many challenges the cities are facing today. But its characteristics in Delhi are varied, leading to different outcomes for sections of the society.

Much of the urban farming in the national capital is on the opposite sides of a spectrum. Either it is a livelihood strategy for the economically weaker section or a means to self-supply organic vegetables for the rich.

We explore a few ideas to help make urban agriculture an inclusive practice to make Delhi an ‘edible city’, while improving the urban ecology.

Agricultural practices on Yamuna floodplain

Agriculture in Delhi was not recognised; hence, farming on the floodplain was traditionally regarded as a nuisance.

The farmers engaged in Yamuna floodplain agriculture are invisible and vulnerable. They do not own the lands and have to pay rent. They are deemed as encroachers and live in constant fear of eviction from the authorities.

Heavy rains or the release of water from barrages flood their entire lands and damages their yield. Since they are mostly invisible from government policies for urban areas, they rarely have any advantages.

At present, there is no support system for farmers’ welfare and farming activities, according to a report by People’s Resource Center in 2022. People’s Resource Center is a forum to create community resources for social transformation and to build perspectives and alternatives.

The climate and ecological crisis have brought forth the need for policies to support urban agriculture.

Agriculture on the Yamuna floodplain was acknowledged in the Master Plan for Delhi-2041. It provides plans for the green-blue assets in Delhi’s Zone O, the river Yamuna and its floodplain.

Some schemes utilise the area near the river for urban agriculture rather than just keeping it as an area for leisure activities. It also involves local communities in understanding the importance of river-people connection, a clean environment, disposal of untreated sewage and waste and building flood-resilient housing.

The master plan is also creating public awareness regarding the river Yamuna and its floodplain to initiate the restoration of the ecosystem, according to Delhi Development Authority, 2021.

The proper implementation of policies would give the farmers recognition to avail license, access and own lands, access to consumers and better management of natural and social resources.

The financial constraints to hiring external labour need to be addressed, so their children do not need to skip school to meet the labour shortage. Setting up farmers’ organisations will help them raise their concerns to higher authorities and avail benefits.

Instead of a top-down decision-making approach, the government needs to understand the problems of the floodplain farmers and incorporate their concerns into the planning. Also, cleaning the polluted Yamuna is crucial for fear-free farming along its floodplain.

Inclusive farming policies

The highly dense character of Delhi creates a huge land demand, making owning or renting expensive and inaccessible to most of the population.

Due to high rents, limited accessibility to land, and high input costs, farming on privately allotted land remains an exclusive practice. Few individuals or private organisations can manage the overall process’s high expenditure.

The nature of production also remains restricted for personal consumption or exclusive consumers. It creates social inequalities and inaccessibility, moving away from supporting livelihoods, food security and self-sustainability.

There is a potential field for intervention to fill in the gaps for inclusive progress of farming practices in the city.

The appropriate approach for inclusive farming practices in the city lies at the intersection of accessibility to land resources, inclusive policymaking and increasing government-community interactions and participation.

All resources need to be brought in for equitable progress, creating easier accessibility and awareness to forward the acceptance and engagement of these practices.

How can we move forward?

The vacant spaces in the built environment become a potential resource for urban farming practices with a focus on making ways to make it equally accessible to all practitioners.

Enhanced interaction between the authorities and community about farming initiatives should be the way forward. The objective is to promote more participation from the people with regular awareness campaigns about best practices and the benefits of engagement.

The city’s land use and planning policies should also incorporate farming practices and focus on reclaiming extra land around public spaces, pathways, parking lots and vacant plots for better utilisation as cultivable green spaces.

These initiatives also reduce the burden of limited access to expensive land and rentals in the city, promoting further participation from people and allowing sustainable revitalisation of vacant land.

Urban home gardening

Home food gardening has primarily remained an elitist practice in Delhi and only a section of the society has the resources and support system to set up these gardens. The high costs for establishment and maintenance limit the scope for its wide adoption.

Urban home gardening has recently received policy attention in Delhi through a ‘smart urban farming’ campaign proposal in the latest budget. The campaign looks promising, though there are some concerns to address.

Special efforts are needed to make such campaigns inclusive, affordable, and accessible for all.

Especially when the number of beneficiaries is negligible (around 10,000) for a tier-1 city like the national capital, there should not be any stringent criteria to select the beneficiaries so that people from lower economic classes can also reap it.

The technologies and practices being disseminated should be affordable for all and adaptable to all types of residential areas of Delhi. The cost incurred to the beneficiaries should be lower after deducting the subsidy amount.

There are examples from other states where ready-to-start gardening units (25 grow-bags planted with vegetable seedlings) are distributed at Rs 500, after a 75% subsidy.

Support from the research institutes in Delhi is also vital for developing space-and resource-saving technologies. Strong engagement of residence associations is also essential to ensure strong coordination of urban home gardening practices.

Integrated food production in commercial buildings

At present, building-integrated gardening on commercial buildings is limited to ornamental plants. To make an ‘edible city’, such spaces can also be used for food production.

Although rooftops are private spaces, some examples in India show the establishment of community gardens on the rooftops of commercial buildings.

Enabling self-help groups to take up rooftop cultivation on government and private-owned buildings would help bring otherwise unused spaces under food production. It will also facilitate socio-economic development and improve urban ecology.

Formulation of effective government guidelines is crucial in lending out public and private roof spaces to set up such community gardening practices.

Changes at institution level crucial

Institutional-level changes are the crux of making urban agriculture an inclusive and affordable practice in Delhi.

The multifunctionality of urban agriculture that provides social, ecological and economic functions needs to be recognised. It will help make such agriculture an integral part of the urban fabric and help build an edible city.

Urban agriculture should be supported with an annual budget, strengthening of agriculture extension services, and active engagement of various stakeholders in community-based decentralised urban agriculture practices.",1
798778,"Punjab to use ancient broadcasting technique to grow rice this Kharif, save groundwater","DSR can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35% over the traditional process of transplanting rice seedlings from a nursery to waterlogged fields

The Punjab government has decided to bring an area of 1.2 million hectare (mha) of under the Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) method in the upcoming Kharif sowing season to conserve water while sowing paddy.

This is double the area that was sown under DSR in 2021 (0.6 mha). DSR is also called the ‘broadcasting seed technique’, under which seeds are directly drilled in the fields.

The field is laser levelled and a pre-sowing (rauni) irrigation is done. The field is prepared to optimum soil moisture condition and paddy (non-basmati) is seeded immediately. This technique saves groundwater and thus electricity, as opposed to the traditional water-intensive method.

It can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35 per cent over the traditional process of transplanting rice seedlings from a nursery to waterlogged fields.

The target was set after Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann and state agriculture officers met with different farmer unions and groups April 17, 2022.

“We are organising training camps and making short videos to spread awareness and motivate them to adopt DSR. We are also taking views of farmers who adopted DSR last year on what kind of challenges they faced so as to work on them this time,” Gurvinder Singh, director of agriculture, Punjab, said.

The government had set a target of a million hectares last year but could bring only 0.6 mha under DSR. However, this was the state’s highest so far and 0.1 mha more than the 2020 figure.

DSR has been slowly gaining popularity. It picked up more during 2020 when Punjab and Haryana faced a labour crunch caused by migration of workers during the COVID-19 lockdown and farmers shifted to DSR, which is not labour-intensive.

MS Bhullar, principal agronomist, Punjab Agriculture University (PAU) said some farmers have also pointed out that there should be regular supply of short duration variety seeds during the DSR period, like during the transplanting period and the government has agreed to that.

The government has set the period for DSR sowing between May 25 and June 5. Conventional transplanting sowing begins after June 15-20.

Rice is the major kharif crop of India and is grown in all the major agrarian states such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Since groundwater is the main source of irrigation in these states, rice cultivation by transplanting has depleted the water table.

In Punjab, for instance, the groundwater declined in about 85 per cent of the state between 1984 and 2016, according to Central Ground Water Board data.

In such a scenario, DSR can help reduce water consumption by as much as 35 per cent, according to the 2011 study published in the journal Advances in Agronomy.

“There are only two ways to save groundwater. Either diversify from paddy to other crops or adopt water-saving techniques to grow paddy,” Bhullar said.

PAU’s recommendation for DSR in 2010 was only for medium to heavy textured soils, but demonstrations in 2020 showed the refined DSR technology can work even in sandy loam soils.

This has increased the area suitable for DSR in Punjab to 85 per cent from 45 per cent, Bhullar said.",1
798818,Historic win for farmer seed rights: PepsiCo’s IPR on potato variety revoked,"Judgement against Pepsico potato variety sets precedent for all seed and food and beverages corporations not to transgress farmers’ seed rights and freedoms in India, experts say

The Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV&FR) Authority December 3, 2021 revoked a PVP (plant variety protection) certificate granted to PepsiCo India Holding (PIH) on a potato variety (FL-2027) on multiple grounds.

This means that Pepsico’s Intellectual Property Right (IPR) granted on the potato variety in a PVP certificate in February 2016 will be taken back.

The application to revoke the certificate was filed by activist Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture June 11, 2019.

This was soon after the PIH withdrew the cases filed against farmers in Gujarat courts for growing “its registered variety”, under pressure from an intense public campaign.

This was the first time that IPR infringement cases on planting material were filed against farmers in India.

The certificate was revoked on multiple grounds. This included the following:

the grant of the certificate of registration had been based on incorrect information furnished by the applicant (Section 34 (a))

the certificate had been granted to a person not eligible for protection (Section 34(b))

the breeder did not provide the Registrar with such information, documents or material as required for registration (Section 34 (c))

the grant of the certificate of registration was not in the public interest (Section 34 (h)) of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights (PPV&FR) Act 2021

The revocation application was filed June 11, 2019 and the authority took almost 30 months in arriving at this conclusion. The company now has just about two months of the original registration time period left which was till January 31, 2022.

However, the registration certificate given to the company was renewable upto January 31, 2031, but now stands revoked.

Read:

“This judgement sets a precedent for all seed and food and beverages corporations and other registrants to not only uphold, but also more importantly, not to transgress the legally granted farmers’ seed rights and freedoms in India,” a statement by Kuruganti said.

Shalini Bhutani, legal researcher and IPR expert in agriculture and biodiversity called the judgement “historic”:

This judgement of the authority is significant and historic. It upholds farmers’ seed freedoms as contained in Section 39 of the PPV&FR Act, which makes this sui generis law of India truly unique.

Bhutani noted that the authority’s acceptance of the revocation application, including on grounds of being against public interest, sent an important signal that farmers’ rights were not to be taken lightly by IPR-holders in India.

“This should prevent further intimidation of farmers through vexatious IP lawsuits,” she said.

She added that the PPV&FR Act 2001 provides routine legal provisions for opposition to the IP registration at the time of grant of registration.

Meanwhile, Kuruganti noted that the interpretation of ‘public interest’ by the authority in its judgement was “very progressive” and was a victory for farmers in the country, especially of the potato farmers in Gujarat who strongly resisted Pepsi’s onslaught on their rights in 2019.

“Companies should not think that they are at liberty to harass farmers — we are watching and will disallow any such mischief. For us, any intimidation and harassment of farmers is clearly a matter of public interest,” she said.

Kuruganti hoped that the authority would proactively put into place all measures and mechanisms possible to ensure that farmers’ rights were not violated at any cost.",1
798846,Gene study shows how to get more out of sorghum without affecting natural resources,"The sorghum variety jowar is one of India’s most important food and fodder crops

Genes that can increase the grain size of sorghum, a versatile grain crop used for human consumption, fodder and bioenergy generation, have been discovered, according to a new report.

Bigger grain size can improve the usage value of the crop, scientists from the University of Queensland (UQ), Australia and the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, who conducted the study, said.

The variety of the crop found in India is called jowar. It is said to have its origin in the country and is one of its most important food and fodder crops. Jowar has a dedicated All-India Coordinated Research Project since 1969.

Sorghum plants are very hardy and can withstand high temperature and drought conditions.

“Larger grains make it more digestible for both people and animals and improves processing efficiency,” said David Jordan, professor at the Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation (QAAFI).

About 80 per cent of the crop’s grain size characteristics depend on genes, and can thus be inherited, according to QAAFI Research Fellow Yongfu Tao. The quality of the yield can be improved without much alterations to environmental resources, such as water or nitrogen, he added.

Tao used genetic information available for other cereals such as rice and wheat to identify the genes associated with grain size on the sorghum genome.

Wild varieties of domesticated sorghum and Australian native sorghum were studied for over six years, the report stated.

“New variants have been identified that are capable of doubling grain weight,” the scientist said. He added:

As many as 125 regions in the sorghum genome have now been identified where variation in the DNA sequence was associated with grain size and response to environmental conditions.

The findings were published in The Plant Journal last month.

The grain is popular across the world because it has a low glycaemic index, is gluten-free and nutritious, according to the authors of the report. The lower the glycemic index of a cereal, the lower is the relative rise in blood glucose level after two hours of consuming it.

The research was funded by the Australian Research Council, with support from the Queensland Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Grains Research and Development Corporation and UQ.",1
798847,Turmeric soaps pave way for financial independence of Koraput’s tribal women,"Around 1,2000 tribal women in the area have managed to eke out a living making turmeric soaps

Soap bars made from turmeric roots, known for its antiseptic property, has helped the tribal women in Odisha’s Koraput district eke out a living.

Each year, around 1,000 tonnes of turmeric is harvested in hilly areas of the district that are conducive for the plant growth, according to an official of the Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS). Recently, the tribal population of the region has discovered a way of utilising the surplus produce.

They were provided grinding machines and training in soap crafting by the government-managed ORMAS and the Central Horticultural Experiment Station, Bhubaneswar.

“Around 1,200 tribal women are earning income by making turmeric soaps,” said Roshan Kumar Kartik, deputy chief executive, ORMAS.

“Our living condition has improved and we are now able to save Rs 4,000 a month,” said Kanti Miniaka of Konapadi village, who participated in training programmes organised by a self-help group run by 20 women.

The tribal people collect turmeric from the fields and ground them into fine powder. The powder is kneaded with almond oil in a heat-safe container and heated. The resulting mixture is cooled and shaped into moulds.

The herb is popular in the beauty industry for its purifying and anti-acne properties and thus, the soap has found many takers in urban areas like Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.

Each soap sells for Rs 50, added Kartik. “I made around Rs 3,000 per month in the last six months,” said Gita Muska of Tayaput village.

Muska had joined a self-help group in her locality where she was taught the art of making soaps from turmeric.",1
798880,Agristack: The new digital push in agriculture raises serious concerns,"These concerns are about information asymmetry, data privacy and consent, profiling of farmers, mismanaged land records and corporatisation of agriculture

On April 13, 2021, the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Microsoft Corporation to start a pilot project in 100 villages of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. The MoU requires Microsoft to create a ‘Unified Farmer Service Interface’ through its cloud computing services.

This sets in motion the ministry’s plan of creating ‘AgriStack’ (a collection of technology-based interventions in agriculture), on which everything else will be built.

The government, through this MoU, aims to provide ‘required data sets’ of farmers’ personal information to Microsoft to develop a farmer interface for ‘smart and well-organised agriculture’.

Thereafter, the ministry signed four other MoUs — with Star Agribazaar, Patanjali Organic Research Institute for agricultural management and services, Amazon Internet Services, and Esri India on June 1 for different operations under AgriStack.

On the same day, the government published a consultation paper called The India Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture (IDEA), laying out a proposed framework for ‘AgriStack’, for public feedback by June 30.

Incidentally, the paper came three weeks after some 55 groups put out a letter demanding that the government make public the details on the MoU with Microsoft and go for a public consultation on the digital push in agriculture.

With these MoUs, agriculture has become the latest sector getting a boost of ‘techno solutionism’ by the government. But it has, since then, also become the latest sector to enter the whole debate about data privacy and surveillance.

Since the signing of the MoUs, several concerns related to sharing farmers’ data with private companies (the major one being Microsoft whose owner Bill Gates is said to be the largest private farmland owner in the US by an analysis done by The Land Report in January 2021), have come to light.

In all the MoUs, there are provisions under which the agriculture ministry will enter into a data sharing agreement with the private companies of the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Patanjali.

The government has now invited more technology / agritech players for collaboration, even though there is no information on the process or criteria of selecting the first five companies.

What do the MoUs say?

The MoU with Star Agribazaar mentions, among other things, ‘farmer data sanitisation’, land profiling and crop estimation using remote sensing in three districts of Kota (Rajasthan), Guna (Madhya Pradesh) and Mathura (Uttar Pradesh). It mentions building a generalised advisory platform for farmers, including mobile applications, for pre- and post-harvest advisories.

The MoU with Patanjali talks about developing a mobile application for advising farmers on soil nutrition, accurate quantification on farmer crop and yield, fertiliser recommendations, and training farmers for using this application in three districts — Haridwar (Uttarakhand), Hamirpur (Uttar Pradesh) and Morena (Madhya Pradesh).

In the MoU with Amazon Internet Services, it is discussed that the company will build a “National Agri Data Stack” that can serve as a foundational data layer on which “agri focussed solutions” will be built. It will also offer its cloud services to solution providers / partners to help build “solutions across agri value chain” and will also help agriculture related start-ups.

The Esri India MoU discusses how the company will support the ministry in establishing a ‘national agriculture geo hub’, provide the required GIS tools and technologies and create and collate farmer and other agriculture data services on GIS platform.

The development has raised serious concerns about information asymmetry, data privacy and consent, profiling of farmers, mismanaged land records and corporatisation of agriculture.

Serious concerns

The project was being implemented in the absence of a data protection legislation. It might end up being an exercise where private data processing entities may know more about a farmer’s land than the farmer himself, warned Rohin Garg, associate policy counsel, Internet Freedom Foundation.

He added:

The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is currently still with the Joint Parliamentary Committee. Despite its shortcomings, it does provide some key protections to users such as basic user rights to correction, deletion and erasure as well as consent-based mechanism for the processing of data and purpose limitation obligations. It also allows for a Data Protection Authority to administer and regulate the processing of data.

Without such safeguards, private entities would be able to exploit farmers’ data to whatever extent they wish to, Garg noted.

This information asymmetry, tilted towards the technology companies, might further exploit farmers, especially small and marginal ones.

Garg said:

One of the biggest worries is the threat of financial exploitation. We have already seen how microfinance firms have wreaked financial havoc in rural hinterlands. Now, once Fintech companies are able to collect granular data about the farmers’ operations, they may offer them usurious rates of interest precisely when they would be in the direst need for credit.

The formation of ‘Agristack’ also implies commercialisation of agriculture extension activities as they will shift into a digital and private sphere.

“The government is saying all services and advisories can be provided now digitally and privately. This is a continuation of the model where private players priced services delivery is supposed to be relied upon rather than the old model of public agriculture extension through officers on the ground,” R Ramakumar, professor, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, said.

“It also points to failure of public sector agencies in agriculture research and extension although we boast of one of the largest networks of public funded agriculture research institutions in the world,” Rajesh Krishnan, chief executive, Thirunelly Agri Producer Company Ltd, a farmer producer organisation (FPO), said.

With this, the risk of commodifying agriculture and farmer data ran high. Agristack could strengthen the asymmetry in information flow by providing all information about farmers and their farming easily to corporations who looked at farmers as a consumer base, be it agri inputs — seed, chemical fertiliser and pesticides, machinery companies or fin-tech companies and to those for whom farmers were suppliers like the food industry, garment industry, etc, Krishnan said.

He also pointed out that FPOs had become the new data collection points as well market channels for the seed and agrochemical industry as well as agri commodity traders.

This data can be sold by the companies to private input dealers and input companies to aid their marketing network.

“For example, if diseases are being reported from one region and this information is available to pesticide companies, they can improve their marketing in that region. So, this kind of commodification of the data is the revenue model which will be broadly followed,” Ramakumar said.

Although there is a non-disclosure agreement in the MoU, there is also a clause on ‘limitation of liability’ which essentially provides indemnity for breach of contract.

“The net result of all this legalese is essentially that farmers’ data is being provided to the companies at their word with little consequence for breaking it,” Nachiket Udupa, associated with the Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, said.

Agendra Kumar, Esri India’s managing director, addressed some of the concerns. He said:

As a part of the MoU, we will set up a Geo hub, which is a GIS system where all the data can be brought together and analytics can be run to create valuable insights for the agriculture department and the farmers. By setting up a geo hub as a ‘proof of concept’, it will be easy to understand how this technology can help in improving the welfare of the farmers and their incomes. We will share the technology with the government and it will be their prerogative on how they want to use the data generated with that technology.

Kumar added that agriculture was an area where the potential for digital technology and GIS was immense. He also said some state governments were already using their technology.

Down To Earth reached out to Vivek Agarwal, additional secretary (digital) and representatives of the remaing four companies. DTE is yet to receive a response.

Experts agree that data and technology can provide a fillip to farmers but only when they remain at the top of this stack that the government is building.

This is the first in a two-part series",1
798896,Patiala village uses unique method to treat wastewater,"The wastewater treatment plant in Dhingi village uses the Seechewal method to use treated wastewater for irrigation and prevent further pollution of groundwater

A new wastewater treatment plant opened recently in a village in Punjab’s Patiala district uses a method devised by one of the state’s leading environmentalists, Sant Balbir Singh Seechewal, to treat, recycle and reuse wastewater.

The impact of climate change, pollution and a lack of infrastructure means villages in India often face water shortage for agricultural and domestic purposes. Water-intensive crops, low water efficiency and unregulated groundwater are the main factors that account for agriculture water demand.

The plant in Dhingi village of Patiala aims to achieve the following objective using the ‘Seechewal Model’ of wastewater management:

Recycling and reusing the treated wastewater for irrigation

Preventing further contamination of groundwater

The model is a pipe-and-pump formula used to remove heavy solid particles, oil and other material from water. It was introduced by Sant Baba Balbir Singh Seechewal and was first used in Seechewal, Punjab.

The project aims to implement a combination of processes through four-well systems of wastewater treatment for reuse apart from human consumption.

The water wells need to be cleaned regularly; otherwise, they produce extremely poor effluents with high suspended solids, which can be detrimental to the constructed wetland and cause clogging of beds.

To ensure continuous and effective operation, the accumulated material must be emptied periodically.

The project is likely to benefit 350 households and 2,755 people in total, Rajesh Verma, chief functionary and secretary, Akhil Bhartiya Gramin Uthan Samiti, said. He added:

“The project will reduce the usage of freshwater by providing an option of treated water to farmers. It will aim at water sustainability with appropriate technologies of water recycle-reuse-recharge.”

He added that the project has engaged, empowered and evolved community sustained processes for water management and strengthened community collectives.",1
798911,"Crop nutrient management using digital tool improves yield, reduces greenhouse gas emissions: Study","More than 80% of 1,594 participating farmers reported an increased crop yield and farm income, according to the study

Use of field-specific fertiliser in Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) can increase grain yield and reduce greenhouse gas emissions compared with typical / traditional farmer fertilisation practices (FFP). They also lead to reduced costs and increased incomes for farmers.

These were the findings of a study conducted between 2013 and 2017 during rice and wheat cropping seasons, published in Nature Scientific Report in January 2021. An international team of scientists led by International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT) compared 1,594 farms in Haryana, Punjab and Bihar.

Reduction of excess nutrient application and balanced fertiliser use are the key mitigation options in agriculture.

Trial at each farm had two paired plots — one with a fertiliser recommendation determined by a digital nutrient tool — Nutrient Expert (NE) — and the other with FFP. The application rates of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P2O5) and Potash (K2O) were studied in each comparison trial in rice and wheat fields under NE and FFP.

FFP are the traditional farming practices adopted by farmers depending on their knowledge and experience.

NE was developed in 2013 by International Plant Nutrition Institute in collaboration with CIMMYT, and the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and provides nutrient recommendations for individual farmer fields in the absence of any soil health data.

Overall, the NE-based recommendations reduced nitrogen input by 15-35 per cent, increased grain yield by 4-8 per cent and reduced global warming potential by 2-20 per cent. More than 80 per cent participating farmers reported an crop yield and farm income, according to the study.

Excess and improper use of nutrients in crop production has many implications on environment, food security as well as farmer’s livelihoods in the form of greater costs involved. Improving nutrient use efficiency is, therefore, critical, the report underlined.

It said:

“Rice and wheat are the major crops grown in India and consume 50 per cent of the fertiliser used in the country. The study in India was particularly important because India consumes 14 per cent of total fertiliser use globally but its nitrogen use inefficiency is one of the lowest in the world. This is mainly driven by imbalanced and inadequate use of nutrients given the skewed government’s subsidy on nitrogenous fertiliser than on other nutrients.”

The study found a significant reduction in the amount of nitrogen use in both rice and wheat crops compared to the FFP. Similarly, phosphorus input was also lower under NE-based recommendations than FFP, except for rice in Western IGP.

The study also observed that several farmers in the IGP region were not using potash on rice and wheat crops and therefore, the input was higher under NE than under FFP.

In general, farmers did not use potassium fertiliser, which leads to an imbalance in nutrients and which ultimately reduces the efficiency of other applied nutrients.

“Many farmers in the study areas either avoid or practice low application of P2O5 and K2O. NE balances the fertiliser use with adequate application of P2O5 and K2O,” it said.

The NE tool estimates the attainable yield through information provided by farmers about growing conditions, determines the nutrient balance in the cropping system based on yield and nutrients applied to previous crops, and combines such information with soil characteristics to predict the crop response to nitrogen, phosphorous and potash. It then generates nutrient recommendations specific to that field.

This reduced overall input, the study said, reduced costs for farmers. It also led to lower global warming potential (GWP) and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Fertiliser management can lower GWP by about 2.5 per cent in rice and between 12 and 20 per cent in wheat over FFP, the study noted.

The study established that adoption of NE-based fertiliser recommendation practice in all rice and wheat acreage in India would translate into reduction in greenhouse gases of 5.34 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent per year over farmers’ current practice.

It also said there was an increase in rice and wheat production by 13.92 million tonnes and 1.44 million tonnes respectively with less fertiliser use.

Compared to FFP, NE reduced the total fertiliser cost for many farmers (45 per cent in rice and 49 per cent in wheat). The reduction came mainly from reduced nitrogen application.

Moreover, at least 64 per cent of rice growers and 77 per cent of wheat growers realised yield increases despite the reduction in nitrogen application on both crops.

“Only 15 per cent rice growers and 12 per cent wheat growers experienced yield losses due to NE, but with decreased nitrogen application, probably because the farmers were applying nitrogen beyond the economic optimum,” the research said.",1
798915,IIT-K scientists design mobile pesticide sprayer that runs on solar energy,"The device will save labour and time for small and marginal farmers

Scientists from IIT Kharagpur have developed a mobile pest-control device that runs on solar power. The semi-automated device will reduce the labour of farmers who have to manually spray pesticides or use fossil-fuel based machines for the same. The innovation, meant mostly for small and marginal farmers, will also ensure pesticides are not wasted and the distribution is uniform.

Prevention of pests during different growth stages of crops is important to increase yield. But the process is labour and time-intensive. In smaller tracts of lands, the farmers usually use knapsack sprayers in which the cultivator has to carry the entire volume of pesticide on their back while moving around the field to spray.

“This impacts the efficiency of spraying as it depends on the skill of the operator leading to non-uniformity in spraying,” the scientists said in a statement to the press.

The device resembles a vegetable cart with three wheels and a roof of solar panels. The main system consists of a propelling unit fitted with a liquid storage tank and a DC motor-operated pump to pressure the liquid to be sprayed, the press note described.

Multiple numbers of spray nozzles are mounted on a boom fitted to the front of the machine. An operator is required to control the movement of the spraying unit.

“It can be easily operated in the field using solar energy with a maximum speed of two kilometres per hour, and can cover a width of 1.5 metres at a time with a field efficiency of 81 per cent, thus saving time, human involvement and chemicals,” remarked Hifjur Raheman, a professor in the department of agriculture, food engineering at the university and a member of the team that created the device.

Raheman conceptualised and designed the product with Anup Behera Rahul K and PBS Bhadoria from the department. They have filed a patent for the sprayer and it is ready for commercialisation.

About 82 per cent of the country’s farming community is categorised as small or marginal, according to Food and Agriculture Organization. These farmers have less than two hectares of land, according to the Union Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare.

With the view to improve the condition of such farmers and to double their income by 2022, the government is focusing on technological innovations, read the institute’s press statement. “This is an open call to the technical institutions in India to deliver in the field of precision agricultural technologies. In the IIT system, IIT Kharagpur has the sole distinction of having an agricultural and food engineering department. Hence it is our foremost responsibility to answer this call,"" remarked Virendra K Tewari, director, IIT Kharagpur.",1
798994,New targets to protect biodiversity must include farmers and agriculture,"Africa’s protected areas cover an area of 20.4 million km² or 15.1% of the landmass. But experts say this isn’t enough.

The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity is a treaty that aims to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of a country’s natural resources, or biological diversity. This is a general strategy that all countries must then adopt at the local level.

The Convention – a legally-binding international treaty – is currently negotiating new targets for the next 30 years. Decisions are made by parties to the convention, made up of 196 countries, supported by a range of observers including NGOs, researchers and academics.

Read more: We're coming up with a new set of targets to protect the natural world. Here's how

But the Convention is about to make a mistake: it concentrates primarily on protected areas when it should also recognise the potential of managing agricultural landscapes for biodiversity.

In its “modified zero draft”, released in October, of 20 targets only one refers to “agricultural and other managed ecosystems”. But its focus is essentially on biodiversity for food. It misses the point that agro-ecosystems can contribute to conservation through providing habitat to wild species and harbouring fragments of natural habitat, such as forests and wetlands.

Africa’s protected areas cover an area of 20.4 million km² or 15.1% of the landmass. But experts say this isn’t enough. For instance, 7% of Kenya’s land is formally protected but between 20-30% of contiguous habitat is needed to maintain populations of “umbrella” species. Protecting these species indirectly protects many other species within its habitat.

Given population pressure, it is not politically feasible to increase the extent of protected areas. The question is how will Africa provide space for its wildlife and food production?

Agriculture dominates sub-Saharan African economies. It contributes on average 15% of total GDP, covers vast tracts of land and is often the main source of livelihoods in rural areas.

We argue that the new framework must recognise the importance of agriculture for conservation. And that the best way to protect Africa’s biodiversity is to integrate conservation measures on working lands. This will also create jobs and income opportunities for farming communities.

An international treaty that draws attention away from this huge stock of land – where biodiversity conservation could be actively supported with investments into mixed farming regimes – runs the risk of skewing policies. It will also miss the opportunity to bring ministries of agriculture and environment together to tackle one of the biggest challenge of the decade.

Land sharing that works

The Convention on Biological Diversity has traditionally seen agriculture as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. It has promoted the protection of natural ecosystems by concentrating on preventing further expansion of agriculture. But evidence shows that farms that share landscapes with wild nature, such as remnant forests and trees, benefit from the ecosystem services provided.

Farming systems that integrate conservation combine a diversity of crops, animals and trees – with different spatial and seasonal arrangements – and mimic natural water and nutrient processes.

This creates less need for artificial inputs like fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides. These farming systems are in line with the traditional farming practices of small holders in sub-Saharan Africa and integrate well with traditional knowledge and practices.

There are examples of the successful relationship between farmers, agriculture and conservation all over the continent.

For instance in Ethiopia, cereal farmers use nearby forests to feed livestock. The livestock roam the forest during the day and return to farms at night, providing farmers with organic fertiliser.

This is important for smallholder farmers because the availability and accessibility of agricultural inputs – such as fertilisers – remain low. Farms close to forests have better soil fertility and produced more nutritious food than those part of an intensified cereal landscape. And forests benefit because they’re not being cleared for agriculture.

Another example is the 400 km2 Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya’s Laikipia County. Ol Pejeta is home to 130 black rhinos and 7,500 cattle. It has increased the black rhino population by 100% in 10 years. In 2019, it employed 700 people and generated US$1.4 million from livestock production and US$4.8 million from tourism.

The business model is multi-dimensional. By optimising tourism and livestock production, the conservancy can generate higher economic returns per hectare than by specialising on one dimension. Their success demonstrates that one key to wildlife conservation in Kenya is not to protect more areas, but turn conservation into a profitable business.

Grey areas

The debate about whether agriculture should be kept separate from conservation shouldn’t presented be as a black or white choice. There are many shades of grey in land-use planning.

“Land sparing” – where agriculture is kept separate – is supposed to address trade-offs between productivity and conservation by maximising productivity in one place while leaving other places in “natural” condition. One critique of this is that in most cases crop productivity is the sole criterion of performance, not managing the trade-offs between economic, social and environmental objectives.

Other studies, show that incorporating other criteria – for example livestock productivity, sustainability, resilience, equitability, ecosystem service provision – may portray a different situation: one less dominated by short term trade-offs, but rather by synergies where one land use might support other objectives. This would contribute to more food security in the long run.

What are the implications?

International biodiversity policy will have impact on land use over the next 30 years. Countries will plan investments around policies they have signed. Donors will align with international commitments. Developing countries will find that funding is channelled through instruments aligned with global policies.

International funding instruments need to be available so that African governments can ensure their farming communities live and prosper in harmony with nature. African farmers deserve a convention that recognises the importance of protected natural landscapes but also of managing wild biodiversity sustainably in farming landscapes.

799014,"After Sikkim, Lakshadweep set to turn 100% organic","The use of synthetic chemicals for agriculture was halted completely in 2005 by the Union territory

Lakshadweep, after Sikkim, is on its way to become 100 per cent organic.

The Union territory’s agriculture department had submitted a proposal to the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, seeking to declare its entire 32 square kilometre geographical land area as organic.

The proposal was approved October 26, 2020 after receiving required certifications and declarations under Centre’s Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (organic farming improvement programme). Om Prakash Mishra, the agriculture secretary, Lakshadweep, expressed his pleasure on social media over this.

Lakshadweep is physically cut off from the mainland; for the last 15 years, no chemical has been shipped into this territory, except medicines and some cosmetics. This has already made Lakshadweep 100 per cent organic by default, Mishra said.

Lakshadweep consists of 36 islands and is India’s smallest UT. It is a uni-district UT and comprises 12 atolls, three reefs, five submerged banks and 10 inhabited islands. All islands are 220-440 km away from Kochi.

In September 2020, Lakshadweep administration formally declared that its entire farming community was practicing organic agriculture and using organic inputs such as compost, poultry manure, green leaf manure. The UT was following organic or biological methods for plant protection as well.

Synthetic chemicals for agriculture were reduced in a phased manner and stopped completely by 2005, according to the declarations provided by the Lakshadweep administration.

The administration had not spent or earmarked any amount for procurement or distribution of synthetic chemicals in budget since 2005. Neither was any synthetic chemicals for agriculture practice transported from outside to Lakshadweep islands since that time.

The UT administration had imposed a formal uniform ban on sale, use and entry of synthetic chemicals for agriculture purpose from October 2017 onwards to make the islands a chemical-free zone.

All farmers, agriculture units and other stakeholders were instructed to use only organic fertilisers, including locally available organic inputs and organic waste.

According to the requirement of organic certification, no genetically modified organism is allowed to be used in the entire territory.

Opportunities for women

The 100 per cent organic status of Lakshadweep would open new opportunities for women self-help groups. A major portion of the UT’s area is already certified as per the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP) standards by an external organic certification body INDOCERT since 2011.

Through the certification, it is possible to get 150 women self-help groups to scale up their production of virgin coconut oil, tuna pickels, jaggery and other products for export, OP Mishra had tweeted.

Lakshadweep recently constituted an expert committee requested the Union agriculture ministry to get a certified organic status for the territory under the participatory guarantee system (PGS) of India through Centre’s Paramaparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana.

The communication from the agriculture ministry, uploaded by official twitter handle of Department of Fisheries, Union Territory of Lakshadweep, revealed that proposal for declaration of entire territory of Lakshadweep as organic has been approved.

The Union agriculture ministry has asked for further details to generate a village-wise certification under PGS-India programme. A formal announcement regarding this is likely to be made soon.",1
799024,"How Indian states are promoting organic, natural farming","States such as Odisha and Karnataka have started initiatives such as procurement of organic produce and linkages with PDS, ICDS and other schemes

This is the final in the four-part series on the state of organic farming in India

Indian states essentially depend on the Union government’s schemes to promote organic and natural farming. Some states also utilise funds from other schemes such as Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and the Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture to do the job.

A few states, on the other hand, walked the extra mile and started initiatives of their own.

Chhattisgarh, for example, recently took initiatives to promote rural livelihoods along with organic farming. The new Godhan Nyay scheme was launched by Chhattisgarh government in July 2020. The scheme aims to increase income of farmers and cattle ranchers, promote organic compost, reduce chemical fertiliser usage and improve soil health.

It also proposes to purchase cattle dung at Rs 2 per kilogram, convert it to vermin compost and make it available to farmers at Rs 8 per kg.

Then there is Odisha: It introduced an organic farming policy in 2018 and is now planning to launch an organic mission. The central government allotted Sri Sri University in the state to promote organic farming in five districts and make 30 model organic clusters.

The state recently decided to promote organic farming in seven districts through integrated nutrient management — that encompasses promotion of organic clusters initiative under Odisha Integrated Irrigation Project for Climate Resilient — according to Debraj Mohanty, a state bio-chemist of Odisha.

It also started a special programme to promote millets in tribal areas in 2017, which has so far covered about 23,000 hectares. “Under this, farmers are encouraged to adopt organic farming practices to produce millets,” said Dinesh Balam, who is associated with the programme.

Millets are procured by the state government and linked with the Public Distribution System (PDS), which aims to link it with state nutrition programmes such as Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS), mid-day meal, and Integrated Tribal Development Agency welfare hostels.

From September 1, 2020, ragi laddus have been upscaled under ICDS to all 13 blocks of Keonjhar district of Odisha. Malkangiri became the first district to form a ‘committee on agro-ecology and agro-biodiversity’ in May 2020.

Uttarkhand is another example of an Indian state taking maters in its own hands. It was the first state to have an organic farming policy in 2000. A dedicated organic commodity board, a nodal state agency to promote organic farming, was established in 2003.

The board identifies commodity-specific clusters, areas and provides them technical know-how on organic agriculture. The state had 128,000 ha under organic cultivation as on November, 2019, which is around 18 per cent of its net sown area. The plan is to make it a 100 per cent organic state.

“Uttarakhand passed the Organic Agriculture Act, 2019, and declared 10 of its blocks fully organic. These blocks are spread across Dunda, Pratapnagar, Jaihari khal, Jakholi, Augustmuni, Ukhimath, Dewal, Salt, Betalghat and Munsyari. It criminalises the sale and purchase of chemical fertilisers and pesticides in select blocks notified under organic farming,” according to AK Upadhyay, joint director, organic farming, agriculture department, Uttarakhand.

Under the Act, non-profits, private entities and traders will engage in export market and processing of organic products will be regulated. Buyers will be registered for free.

The Act also aims to help simplify the organic certification process and promote brand ‘Uttarakhand Organic’. Upadhyay said the state has its own organic certification agency accredited by the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority.

Vinay Kumar, managing director, Uttarakhand Organic Commodity Board, said: “Organic commodity board connects farmers with buyers by organising buyer-seller meets. It also facilitates farmers for direct sale by organising organic haats, fairs and exhibitions, organic kitchens and organic outlets”.

He added that the organic board started with five commodities in 2005-06 and increased to 22 commodities in 2019-20 with sale amounting to Rs 11.79 crore.

“To help farmers, weekly organic haats are organised on Sundays and Thursdays in prime locations of Dehradun,” Kumar said. The plan is to have 13 organic outlets in every district specifically on pilgrim and tourism route. By the end of 2021-22, 1,500-plus organic outlets are planned.

He added that the state’s new initiative ‘Haritima-The Bamboo huts initiative’ would promote eco-tourism in Uttarakhand. The same has been started with six bamboo huts and will be expanded by 12 by the end of 2020.

The aim of the initiative is to develop these bamboo huts as major eco-tourism hub. To support farmers, organic, makeshift kitchens will be promoted for tourists.

Karnataka’s case is different: The civil society and farmers’ movement have played a critical role there to promote natural farming without any government support, according to Chamarasa Mali Patil, honorary president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), a farmers’ organisation.

He said the KRRS came forward and engaged natural farming experts like Subhash Palekar to organise multiple trainings for farmers. Various farmers leaders volunteered in mass mobilisation for natural farming training camps organised across the state.

The need for natural farming was felt by farmers to get rid of huge debt burdens because of increased cost of cultivation. Besides, natural farming has environmental and health benefits and is a good alternative against costly and harmful chemical fertilisers and pesticides, Patil said.

In 2017, Karnataka brought a new organic farming policy. The new policy focuses on providing value-chain linkages between producers and consumers along with promoting sustainable organic production systems. Policy aims to convert at least 10 per cent of the cultivable area into organic by 2022.

However, as on November 2019, state organic area was 111,000 ha, which is 1.1 per cent of its net sown area.

The Karnataka government facilitated formation and registration of organic farmers associations under the Savayava Bhagya Yojane in 2013-14 through select non-profits. Assistance is also provided to establish organic manure production units, collection of cattle urine and dung, processing and value addition of organic produce.

Since 2015-16, Karnataka has facilitated setting up such organic farmers’ associations throughout the state.

Each farmer association has 70-150 farmers. These associations are federated into 15 regional cooperative organic farmers’ federations covering all 30 districts. They engage in procurement, processing and market related activities with some financial assistance from state.

Since 2017-18, a market-based crop specific organic cluster development has been promoted by the state to develop linkages between farmers and consumers by strengthening supply chain mechanism.

Ashok Tubachi, organic farming advisory committee member in the Karnataka government said: “We are procuring organic produce directly from certified organic farmers groups and selling through various outlets”. He added that the federation provides premium price to farmers. For example, an extra premium of Rs 500 per tonne is provided to sugarcane farmers.

“However, due to lack of revolving funds, we are not able to procure the entire crop produce from farmers,” he added.

Krupa, the president of a Karnataka state-level regional farmers’ federation said the body has 300 outlets and sells the produce to multiple private companies such as Big basket, Jai Keshav exporter, Mera Kisan, Kisan Bharti, etc. The federation also exports the organic produce to countries such as Australia, the United States, Canada and European Union.

Suresh Desai, a renowned organic farmer said “such federations play an important role in helping farmers sell their produce, and that they should be formed across the country to promote natural farming.""

“The state aims to become the millet capital of India. It has started distributing of millets through the PDS, wherein the grains are sourced and distributed locally. Organic millet stores are promoted by the government and coming up across the state,” a senior agriculture department official of Karnataka said.

The state government had also made an announcement of purchasing ragi and jowar with a bonus of 20-25 per cent above the minimum support price from farmers. The same has, however, not been implemented on ground so far.

Karnataka recently launched the Raitha Siri Scheme, under which all millet growers would get cash incentives worth Rs 10,000 per hectare. While several millet growers are not certified, a significant percentage grows millets organically. “Our federation provides 15 per cent premium to farmers for millets, pulses and oilseeds,” said Krupa.

States such as Punjab have not launched any dedicated scheme for organic farming but have been supporting organic farmers by purchasing their crops through Punjab Agri Export Corporation and selling it abroad.

There is a strong need to upscale such initiatives at a larger scale to promote organic and natural farming. Other states should learn or undertake their own initiatives.

Chemical-based agriculture faces sustainability issues and causes damage to people and the planet’s health. Promotion of organic and natural farming will lead to a win-win situation for people and the planet and will contribute to help achieve United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.",1
799064,Three ways farms of the future can feed the planet and heal it too,"Crops, trees and livestock in harmony; pesticides no more; small tech, big difference

Intensive agriculture may be nourishing most of the Earth’s inhabitants, but it’s doing the opposite to earth itself. Its dependence on singular crops, heavy ploughing machinery, fossil-fuel based fertilisers and pesticides is degrading our soils wildlife and nutrient cycles, and contributing a quarter of the planet’s unwanted extra heat.

But we’re not powerless to change the future of food. Nature and technological innovation are tackling these problems head on — and if the solutions they’re offering are incorporated on a large scale and used together, a new agricultural revolution could be on its way. Here are three of the most exciting developments that can help farms not just feed the planet, but heal it too.

Crops, trees and livestock in harmony

Several UN reports have highlighted agroecology — farming that mimics the interactions and cycles of plants, animals and nutrients in the natural world — as a path to sustainable food.

The approach uses a wide variety of practices. For example, instead of artificial fertilisers, it improves soil quality by planting nutrient-fixing “cover crops” in between harvest crops, rotating crops across fields each season and composting organic waste. It supports wildlife, stores carbon, and conserves water through the planting of trees and wildflower banks.

It also integrates livestock with crops. This may seem counter-intuitive given their inefficient land use and high emissions. But having a small number of animals grazing land doesn’t have to accelerate global heating.

Grassland captures carbon dioxide. Animals eat the grass, and then return that carbon to the soil as excrement. The nutrients in the excrement and the continuous grazing of grass both help new grass roots to grow, increasing the capacity of the land to capture carbon.

Keep too many grazing animals in one place for too long and they eat too much grass and produce too much excrement for the soil to take on, meaning carbon is lost to the atmosphere. But if small numbers are constantly rotated into different fields, the soil can store enough extra carbon to counterbalance the extra methane emitted by livestock’s digestive rumblings.

While this doesn’t make them a carbon sink, livestock bring other benefits to the land. They keep soil naturally fertilised, and can also improve biodiversity by eating more aggressive plants, allowing others to grow. And if local breeds are adopted, they generally don’t require expensive feed and veterinary care, as they’re adapted to local conditions.

Pesticides no more

Pests, diseases and weeds cause almost 40% of crop losses globally — and without care, the figure could rise dramatically. Climate change is shifting where pests and diseases thrive, making it harder for farmers to stay resilient.

Many commonly used herbicides, pesticides and fungicides are now also under pressure to be banned because of their negative effects on the health of humans and wildlife. Even if they’re not, growing resistance to their action is making controlling weeds, pests and diseases increasingly challenging.

Nature is again providing answers here. Farmers are starting to use pesticides derived from plants, which tend to be much less toxic to the surrounding environment.

They’re also using natural enemies to keep threats at bay. Some may act as repellents, “pushing” pests away. For example, peppermint disgusts the flea beetle, a scourge to oilseed rape farmers. Others are “pulls”, attracting pests away from valuable crops. Plants that are attractive for egg-laying but that don’t support the survival of insect larvae are commonly used for this purpose.

Technology is also offering solutions on this front. Some farmers are already using apps to monitor, warn and predict when pest and diseases will attack crops. Driverless tractors and intelligent sprayers that can target specific weeds or nutritional needs have recently entered the market. Agritech companies are now also developing robots that can scan fields, identify specific plants, and decide whether to use pesticide or to remove a plant mechanically.

In combination, these methods can dramatically reduce agriculture’s reliance on herbicides and pesticides without lowering crop yields. This is important, since the world’s population is set to rise by a quarter in the next three decades.

Small tech, big difference

Soon, technology at an almost impossibly small scale could make a big difference to the way we grow our food. Companies have designed nanoparticles 100,000 times smaller then the width of a human hair that release fertiliser and pesticides slowly but steadily, to minimise their use and maximise crop yields.

New gene-editing techniques will also increasingly use nanomaterials to transfer DNA to plants. These techniques can be used to detect the presence of pests and nutrient deficiencies, or simply improve their resistance to extreme weather and pests. Given that increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events due to global heating are putting the very functioning of the global food system at risk, these advancements could be vital for preventing agricultural collapse.

Nanotechnologies aren’t cheap yet and researchers have yet to conduct rigorous tests of how toxic nanomaterials are to humans and plants, and how durable they are. But should they pass these tests, agriculture will surely follow the path of other industries in adopting the technology on a large scale.

Save for nanotechnology and advanced robots, the above solutions are already in use in many small-scale and commercial farms – just not in combination. Imagine them working in synchrony and suddenly a vision of sustainable agriculture doesn’t seem so far away anymore.

799417,India conducts the largest field experiment to ward off pink bollworm in cotton,"Share this

31 July 2021, Nagpur: The South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC), Jodhpur in collaboration with Agrovision Foundation, Nagpur has laid out the country’s largest field experiment of an innovative mating disruption or mating confusion technology spread over 300 acres in 4 clusters to ward off a devasting pest pink bollworm (PBW) in cotton in Waroda and Adasa villages in Kalmeshwar Taluka in Nagpur District of Maharashtra.

PBKnot is an innovative mating disruption technology, approved recently by CIBRC of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfares of the Govt of India is an ideal approach for effective PBW management and a best fit in IPM of bollworm management in cotton. Moreover, PBKnot technology is easy in application, safe to beneficial insects and ecofriendly.

A first-of-its-kind field experiment laid out over 300 acres in 4 clusters in GPS coordinated cotton fields with the structured tagging of PBKnot thread by trained local volunteers under the guidance of experts from South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC), Agrovision Foundation and ICAR-CICR will be studied for pest insect population dynamics, insect ecology and damage as part of an integrated pest management approach (IPM) of pink bollworm.

PBKnot

Pink Bollworm – a mysterious pest, hashit cotton growers hard in Maharashtra in Kharif during 2020-21. There has been a noticeable increase in PBW infestation in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and recently in Northern cotton growing belt. Though large scale Bt cotton cultivation provides inbuilt protection against notorious American bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), the emergence of PBW has become the new enemy of cotton farmers. While Helicoverpa infestation resulted in definite yield loss, PBW infestation primarily affects the lint quality, though its early occurrence may even lead to reduction in yield and significant losses.

“We have laid out the country’s largest field experiment by tagging cotton plants with PBKnot in such a way that PBKnot charges the surrounding air with Gossyplure, a pheromone scent that confuses the male adults preventing them for finding and mating with female adults and reduces the number of eggs laid and PBW population in subsequent generations. Interestingly, PBKnot releases the same scent that female PBW releases to attract males for mating,” explained Dr. CD Mayee, President of the South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC), Jodhpur.

“Mating confusion – a disruptive pheromone-based technique, is now available in the form of the solid metric dispenser rope known as PBKnot and can be easily applied to the cotton plant at the pin head square stage over the minimum area of 60 to 64 acres in contiguous basis. The PBKnot can protect cotton plant for 90 days in the crucial time of flowering, boll formation up to boll maturity and hence reduce boll damage, improve quality and increase cotton yield”, said Bhagirath Choudhary, Director of South Asia Biotechnology Centre (SABC), Jodhpur. The outbreak of pink bollworm in 2020 was a wakeup call. Field based solution of rolling out PBKnot technology is an extension of our efforts to help cotton growers in Vidarbha to manage pink bollworm in Kharif 2021, elaborated, Dr Choudhary.

Project Bandhan is supported jointly by PI Foundation and Rasi Seeds Pvt Ltd and is being implemented across Vidarbha, Maharashtra, in partnership with cotton and textile value chain partners. The project aims at demonstrating mating disruption technology, promoting integrated pest management (IPM) based package of practices (POP) developed by ICAR-CICR, intensifying skill development and training programs and amplifying effective PBW control measures to farmers across the Vidarbha region. Project Bandhan enrolled hundreds of farmers in 4 clusters, were given free Bt cotton hybrid seeds & IPM based POP brochures and were engaged in tagging PBKnot thread dispenser in their field on 30th and 31st July 2021.

“Project Bandhan is an exemplary initiative toa promote pheromone based IPM production system of cotton. The novel PB Knot pheromone technology is easy to use, affordable and environmental friendly innovation to manage the devastating pest such as Pink Bollworm,” noted Mr. Prashant Hegde, CEO (Agri Business) at PI Industries Ltd. “As part of the CSR initiative, PI Foundation is keen to support the area wide implementation of Project Bandhan and is committed to sustainable agriculture and environmental protection,” Mr. Hedge added.

“Rasi Seeds Pvt Ltd has been supporting the Pink Bollworm campaign in Vidarbha for the last two years, implemented jointly by the South Asia Biotechnology Centre and Agrovision Foundation. Our joint efforts have resulted in the management of Pink Bollworm, particularly in Vidarbha. We reinforce our commitment to support the innovative technology and programs to improve the cotton production and farmers’ realization. Project Bandhan is a unique program dedicated to showcase the utility, efficacy of novel mating disruption technology and IPM based production system,” stated Dr Ramasami, Chairman of Rasi Seeds Pvt Ltd.

“We have successfully implemented awareness and training programs on pink bollworm in collaboration with South Asia Biotechnology Centre across Vidarbha in the last 3-4 years. Implementing mating disruption technology will help growers to effectively manage pink bollworm in Vidarbha, Maharashtra while outreach program continues to spread right messages about IPM based management of pink bollworm,” stated Sh Ravi Boratkar, President, Agrovision Foundation, Nagpur.

The implementation of PBKnot under the technical guidance of ICAR-Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) was attended by experts including Dr Rama Krishna, Agronomist and Dr Shailash Gawande, Plant Pathologist of ICAR-CICR; Sh Ravi Boratkar, Sh Ramesh Mankar, Sh Rahul, Sh Akash and Sh Akshay of Agrovision Foundation; Dr Sandip Agale of South Asia Biotechnology Centre and elected representatives and hundreds of cotton farmers of Waroda and Adasa villages in Kalmeshwar Taluka in Nagpur District of Maharashtra.",1

Agriculture, with its allied sectors, is the largest livelihood provider in the country. The sector contributes a significant share of around 21% to the overall Gross Domestic Product (GDP). With total exports of agricultural and allied products at US$ 41.25 billion in FY21, India is among the 15 leading exporters of agricultural products in the world.

To harness the untapped potential of this sector, the Government has allowed 100% FDI in the marketing of food products and food product e-commerce under the automatic route. An incentive outlay of Rs 10,900 crore (US$ 1,484 million) for the food processing sector has also been approved under the PLI scheme. In addition, the comprehensive Agriculture Export Policy has been introduced to increase India’s agricultural export to US$ 60 billion by 2021-22 and US$ 100 billion in the next few years.

The sector is set to witness increased investment in agricultural infrastructure such as irrigation facilities, warehousing, and cold storage, with global consumption reaching the pre-pandemic level.

The fortnight will also see participation of several senior government officials from India who will be present during the various sessions.

The ‘Food, Agriculture and Livelihood’ fortnight will conclude on March 2nd.",1
799472,"Brazil, India can steer global transport towards biofuels","Share this

29 April 2022, New Delhi: Brazil has spearheaded some of the paradigm shifts in the field of biofuels, especially bioethanol, way before they became an urgent necessity because of climate change. Biofuels have been a part of Brazil’s National Energy policies for nearly half a century. As a result, the country’s experience of creating an ethanol economy has the potential to support others in developing their strategies and selecting the best pathways to be adopted for successfully integrating ethanol into the fuel economy.

The ethanol economy received a renewed push by the affordable and simple technological novelty of the “flex engine” disseminated in Brazil after 2003, which allows the same vehicle to be powered by 100 per cent ethanol or petrol, or any intermediary mix of the two.

In an effort to green the transportation sector, there is an increasing trend towards electrification of vehicles, which is often misleadingly synonymised with one of its options — battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs). However, ethanol is a meaningful solution for electric vehicles too.

Solid Oxide Fuel Cell technology — which converts ethanol into electricity to power vehicles — has proven to be far more energy efficient and environment-friendly than Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Sugarcane ethanol has higher energy density than batteries, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are significantly less considering the whole energy cycle (‘well-to-wheel’).

Unfortunately, some misinformation has been raised by those located in regions that cannot benefit from a tropical agriculture, who invested heavily in high-tech solutions even if they reduce emissions less than ethanol does. In this sense, the myth that using feedstock for biofuels production undermines food security has been an important deterrent to the large-scale adoption of ethanol.

However, as the Brazilian experience has shown, sugarcane ethanol has, in fact, been able to reduce land competition between food and fuel with improved crop yields and expansion of production on degraded pastures.

Major sugarcane producers

Since blending petrol with sugarcane ethanol can lower GHG emissions up to 90 per cent and sugarcane only needs to be replanted every five to six years (thus, capturing larger amounts of carbon than any other feedstock crop), the high-octane ethanol fuel can play a pivotal role in fighting climate change — the real threat to food security.

Brazil and India are two major developing economies where agriculture forms the backbone of their respective economies. Being tropical countries, the two largest producers of sugarcane in the world are, therefore, well poised to spearhead together ethanol as a global commodity and pave the way for a new international market that favours developing countries in the first place.

India has already advanced its target of 20 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol (E20) by five years to 2025 and the adoption of flex-fuel automobiles will certainly be a game changer.

Recognising the scope of bilateral cooperation in this domain, Brazil and India signed three MoUs in the field of bioenergy cooperation when our leaders met in New Delhi in January 2020. The first meeting of the joint working group on bioenergy was held in 2021.

To spur constant cross-learning on the production, regulatory and technological aspects of ethanol supply chains, several bilateral initiatives have been organised by Brazilian and Indian institutions from the government and the private sector.

Energy transition through biofuels is a great opportunity to create and modernise industries, boost technological innovation, attract investment and generate high quality jobs — all the while contributing to sustainable development and to the quality of life of future generations around the world.",1

799616,India allows sugar exports of a million tonnes more: Sources,"Share this

29 July 2022, New Delhi: In a positive development for the sugar sector, the government has allowed the industry to export additional 1.2 million tonnes of sugar, sources told CNBC-TV18 on Thursday. However, an official notification on the decision is still awaited.

Shares of Shree Renuka Sugars, Balrampur Chini Mills, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, Dhampur Sugar Mills, and Uttam Sugar Mills were up 2-5 percent at the time of writing.

The government’s decision comes after a group of ministers (GoM) recommended allowing additional exports of sugar as mills demanded permission for the same.

The government had capped exports of sugar for this season at 100 lakh tonnes (10 million tonnes) with an aim to keep the domestic prices under control. India has exported a record 10 million tonnes sugar this season due to higher production.

Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) had written to the food ministry to allow exports above the allowed 10 million tonnes.

Currently, India is the second biggest sugar exporter after Brazil. The country is set to surpass Brazil to become the world’s biggest sugar producer in the current marketing year ending September, with a total output of 36 million tonnes, according to the ISMA estimates.

The global sugar prices have fallen to 12-month low, down 6 percent in July alone.

02 May 2022, New Delhi: The Centre has allocated 22.5 lakh tonnes (lt) as the monthly sugar quota for May, up 0.5 lt over the May 2021 quota. In a notification issued by the Directorate of Sugar and Vegetable Oils, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution has allocated the quota to 531 sugar mills across the country. The May 2022 stockholding limit has been worked out on the basis of giving 100 per cent weightage to the month-end notional stock this month.

Market players expect seasonal demand for the commodity as States have relaxed Covid-19 norms.

From October 1 till April 15 (2022), sugar mills across the country have produced 329.91 lt of sugar, 38.09 lt higher than the 291.82 lt produced during the same period a year ago, as per Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) data.

India is the world’s second-largest sugar producer after Brazil. Since 2010-11, India has consistently produced surplus sugar, comfortably exceeding domestic requirements. The International Sugar Organization (ISO) in its March Market report said sugar futures rose in early March in line with higher commodity prices, especially oil and wheat due to the conflict in Ukraine.

01 August 2021, New Delhi: Dhanuka Agritech has launched ONEKIL to provide a complete solution for weed-free Onion crops. The company stated that for the first time, Indian Onion growers will experience ONEKIL, a 9(3) molecule that is a complete solution for weed-free Onion crops, from Dhanuka.

As per the regulatory filing, currently, Onion growers of India are suffering from multiple weed problems out of which major weeds are Narrow-leaf & Broadleaf. ONEKlL (Technical: Quizalofop-Ethyl 4% +Oxyfluorfen 6%EC) is a post-emergence systemic herbicide that controls Narrow Leaf Weeds as well as Broad Leaf Weeds. Once ONEKIL is absorbed by the onion crop’s foliage and root system, it provides longer residual control to most of the weeds.

Moreover, ONEKIL lasts for 1-2 hours and has effective rain fastness. ONEKIL has a dual mode of action and has excellent translocation activity.

796785,"India’s natural, organic farming strategy for rice and wheat","This can help in targeting global export market, thereby feeding the world population and getting valuable foreign exchange for the country

India is predominantly agrarian — 80 per cent of the population is directly or indirectly dependent on agriculture. Rice and wheat are the staple for 90 per cent of the country’s people.

Till the early 1960’s, the predominant mode of cultivation was what is now called “organic farming”, with no synthetic fertilisers or pesticides available or known.

At that time, farmers relied on cow dung, twigs of leguminous plants like Crotalaria juncea, Tephrosia, neem and jeelugu. These materials mulched the fields ploughed for rice plantation. Oil cakes of groundnut, castor, neem were also used which is a good source of nitrogen.

Since the use of urea from the beginning of the 1960s, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium-based fertilisers became available after the establishment of industrial plants at Sindri (Bihar) Udyog Mandal (Kerala).

Fortunately, in this decade, synthetic pesticides like dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), endrin, and others entered the market. Another spectacular discovery was that of the high-yielding hybrid wheat and rice. The high-yielding wheat was discovered by Norman Borlaug (Nobel Prize winner) and was rapidly adopted by India largely due to the pioneering work of Dr Swaminathan and MV Rao.

Swaminathan is remembered as the ‘father of Green Revolution’ and Rao as the “wheat man of India”. With hybrid varieties and synthetic fertilisers and insecticides, the production of rice per acre increased to 40 quintals from 10 quintals, a tremendous victory in fighting hunger.

There were also some setbacks during the 1960s and 70s. India’s budget (read agriculture) is dependent on the monsoon season, as George Curzon pointed out in 1905.

Due to drought from 1964-70, India had to import food and became heavily dependent on the United States for wheat supplies under the Public Law 480 agreement. At one time, we were eagerly waiting for the arrival of a ship full of wheat at the Mumbai port. The late former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri gave a call to “miss a meal” on Monday nights as a part of the Jai Kisan movement.

Green Revolution

Ultimately, the Green Revolution was initiated. The theme of the initiative was to boost food grains production of rice and wheat using any method and at any cost.

Success followed many setbacks. Biologist-turned-science-writer Rachel Carson published a seminal book called Silent Spring, focused on the harmful effects of pesticides, primarily DDT on our health and environment.

DDT was found to be non-biodegradable and its remnants were traced everywhere — in our body, soil and water. Studies showed its effects on liver and kidneys, including causing cancers.

Scientists rapidly found alternatives and advocated Integrated Pest Management (IPM). IPM is a need-based use of pesticides, alternating crops, intercropping as well as usage of bird perches where birds rest, detect insects on crops and eat them.

After DDT, other insecticides like monocrotophos, metasystox, cypermethrin came into use but these are equally harmful to humans, livestock and fish.

The “turn to nature” to get pesticide-free food has become a priority. The order of the day is organic farming — natural farming or zero-budget agriculture — which is welcome and most wanted in the agriculture sphere.

Not without setbacks

The first and foremost sound solution is the usage of organic manures from compost, cow dung and ploughing and mulching of leguminous plants. Several plant-based botanical pesticides were discovered. Neem oil, neem kernel extracts, which contain azadirachtin, is the active principle discovered by Germans, the United Kingdom and US.

Neem revived the hope of using harmless pesticides but its availability is very low. Several commercial formulations were available in India. Karanj oil (Karanjin active principle), several leaf extracts like Adathoda and garlic-buds aqueous extracts are found to be effective to some extent as active repellants but they cannot replace synthetic pesticide.

There is a growing awareness in India to cultivate the crops by natural fertilisers such as cow dung, leguminous green manures, compost, vermicomposting and biopesticides fungi, bacteria and virus-based pesticides like Bacillus thuringiensis, Pseuedomonas aegle, Trichoderma verdi.

These bio-pesticides are chiefly produced from diseased insects and soil, among other things. However, it only has limited use on too few fruit and vegetable crops. The problem with the bio-pesticide production is that it is confined to a small industry with no standardisation and doubtful efficacy.

Several symposia are held by non-governmental organisations, ideal farmers and governments. Many agricultural magazines hail the miracles of higher yields from organic farming. Particular mention should be made about jeevamrutham — a recently designed concoction called Ramabanam, which gained prominence. These concoctions are made from jaggery, ginger, cow milk, cow curd, cow dung, cow urine, asafoetida. All the ingredients are mixed and fermented for a week, diluted and sprayed on crops.

It is claimed that the product can be used as a fertiliser and a pesticide. The farmers who experimented were quick to endorse the products. Their studies on organic farming presented in symposia on organic farming, however, were confined to few vegetables like tomatoes over a limited area. The yield, the farmers said, is high but not quantified with randomised block design studies.

The active principle of such concoctions is unknown and doesn’t stand scientific security. Moreover, the cost of these concoctions is as high as pesticides and starting products like cow dung are not available in plenty as of today.

For about 90 per cent Indians, rice or wheat are almost exclusively the staple food. So, encouragement of organic farming in a country like India will be meaningful, if applied for rice / wheat. Studies on these crops should also be prioritised.

The inconvenient truth, as many farmers put it, is that the land is infertile now without urea in the first few days of rice plantation, and with no application of synthetic pesticides, the entire crop is prone to pests resulting in no yield.

The challenge for agriculture scientists is how to maintain the current volume of yield (40 quintals per acre) with organic farming. We need to take with caution some sporadic success stories of organic farming on vegetables and fruits grown in an acre or two.

Thus, all the available tools we have with us, like bio-fertilisers, bio-pesticides, green manure and vermicompost, their limitation is discussed herein. Constraints of sustainable organic farming are:

None of the organic farming tools are available, especially for organic farming of rice that is the staple food in India. Importantly, the whole organic farming depends on cow dung, which is dwindling even as we are particular about their protection (gosamrakshana).

The staple food for cattle is rice straw. While we claim rice production is high and in surplus, the cost of rice remains very high and is not affordable for the poor man. Thus, the increase of cattle population is linked to paddy by rice production. Both are interlinked.

Quantification for pesticide residues in food should be done by High Performance Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectra / Mass Spectra (HPLC / MS / MS) method. The sophisticated method has been adopted by advanced countries but is still not in use in India.

The real structure of crop production is dependent on high-yielding hybrid seeds. Continuous research on high yielding varieties by cross breeding with pest resistant wild varieties is essential.

Compost from urban areas and vermicompost, in particular, don’t seem to have been examined for pesticide residues and harmful trace elements such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury and lead is needed by using HPLC /MS / MS method and atomic absorption spectroscopy.

Introduction of transgenic varieties is not recommended for organic and natural farming. Therefore, it is wise to use the first three sprays on crops with natural organic materials and the last two sprays with synthetic pesticides.

Research on organic farming should be done using robust scientific methods only. Surprisingly, rice was found to contain high pesticides and trace elements.

This technique should be standardised in India. Our slogan should be “natural and organic farming with high yields at an affordable price to the common man”. India’s wheat exports surpassed $872 million (2021-22) and rice exports in 2021-22 is likely to surpass the record $10 million, according to the agriculture department of the Government of India.

796859,Biotechnology assures leap in production,"Tissue culture can change the face of agriculture, asserts Ajit Thomas, who heads a firm that has gone in a big way for biotechnology in the cultivation of plants and flowers.

AJIT THOMAS, 37, is chairman of A V Thomas & Co, one of south India's leading business houses owning plantations in Palghat and Idukki producing tea, spices and rubber. The company has now expanded into biotechnology and this year, it hopes to reap bumper harvests. Down To Earth interviewed him in Madras recently.



Starting with cardamom in 1986, your company is considered a pioneer in using biotechnology for producing cardamom, bananas, flowers and, now, orchid plants commercially. What made you adopt this techniques?

It began with cardamom. Internationally, Indian cardamom was becoming uncompetitive. The Gautemalan yields were much higher than Indian yields and the domestic market was very strong at that time. So we had to think of some way to increase our yields. The only way to do this was to multiply the yields through tissue culture. Simultaneously, we launched our banana project. Our orchid project is the most recent.



Tissue culture is not the answer to all of the farmer's needs. It is only one more tool that can be used as part of an integrated package of practices to increase productivity. The extra cost for this method is justified by the phenomenal increase in productivity. The increase is exponential.



Was the tissue culture technology you used imported, developed indigenously, or was it modified of imported technology?

There has been minimal import content. The technology that people offer is okay for lab-scale operations. But when we scale it up for commercial production, we run into problems. We have developed the commercial technology in our own laboratory. For cardamom, the initial laboratory technology was developed by the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune. But commercial production using this technology would have made the product very expensive. So we had to modify it. After all, the key to success in business is to produce the right product at the right cost. We were the first to start commercial production using biotechnology and the first commercial lab was ours.



But there must be many more today?

As far as I know, there are about 10 companies in the business. Some, like Indo-American Hybrid Seeds, have made heavy investments. I don't know how they will make themselves viable. Small companies would require a certain amount of capital before they can enter this field. Many of the new entrants put in heavy investments -- anything from Rs 10 crore to Rs 12 crore. Our initial investment was about Rs 2.5 crore and we invested Rs 1 crore in research and development.



What are your feelings about the issue of patents and royalties?

We have already faced a problem with exports. In India there is no system of patents and the result is that importing countries are wary of our quality. Now, we are gaining the confidence of Holland. We get the tissue for flowers from Holland, we multiply them and re-export the product back to that country. In doing this, we have to observe some amount of security because the product should not go out of the lab into other hands. Some stray incidents have happened in the past.



On the question of royalty we do not face a problem. The Dutch growers ask for only a very reasonable amount as they know the cost of collecting the products is very high. For example, in Brazil, 60 per cent of the royalty goes to the agent who collects the products and only 40 per cent goes to the Dutch grower. We do our business mostly with Dutch companies. With the USA, we deal mostly with common foliage plants that have no patent or proprietory rights. On an average, we export close to four million plants a year to both the Netherlands and USA, with a turnover of about Rs 3 crore. You seem to have achieved considerable success with Indian orchids?

Orchids have a lot of potential even in the domestic market. We started our orchid project in early this year and so far we have sold orchid seedlings worth about Rs 35 lakh to 500 women in the country. A good orchid plant can last upto two weeks in non-airconditioned rooms without wilting, but there is the problem of transportation when it comes to exporting the plants. For the products to be acceptable, they have to reach their destination within 48 hours.



What will be your thrust area in the future?

It will continue to be the export of our main products like lily bulbs, foliage and other plants. Domestically the thrust will be on cardamom, banana and orchid production.



We feel that it is vital that we bring down the costs of producing these plants. And that has been the thrust of our research efforts. Our main lab atthe Cochin Export Processing Zone has the capacity for producing 4 million plants annually. We had stagnated at 2 million for quite some time and even thought that we wouldn't be able to cross this figure. Now we produce 6 million and feel that we have the potential for producing upto 10 million to 12 million. And all this is without expanding the lab. We can do it by developing better processes. When you increase your production you can naturally bring costs down. Biotechnology has also revolutionised yields per plant, too. The yield that the company gets from conventional seedlings is about 200 kg per ha. What we expect to harvest from our biotechnologically raised plantations in Idukki and Palghat is to the tune of 400 to 500 kg per ha.



Some of the tissue cultured cardamom plants yield upto 1,100 kg per ha. Compare this to the national average of 60 kg per hectare. Of course, there are people who get yields up to 200 kg from conventional stock, using irrigation and other additional inputs. But with biotechnology there is a quantum leap in production, with help from genetics. Of course, there is an increase in seedling cost, but this increase is arithmethic, while the benefit is exponential.



But what about the disease-resistance and longevity of these plants?

Tissue cultured plants have a shorter yield cycle. There is a definite need to increase their disease resistance. It is difficult to say that the tissue cultured plants will not get diseases in their lifetime. Nobody can say that. If diseases can be kept away for three or four years, we should be happy that we have achieved at least this.



What is the scope of biotechnology?

We, as a company, still have to explore related areas like variations and mutations. So far, we have restricted ourselves to tissue culture. I don't believe in across-the-board application of biotechnology for all activities. I would hate to see tissue culture being used to raise monocultures, like the government does, because I believe that tissue culture is more of a tool for preserving rare varieties and to get better plants. In our plantations, we always mix our clones.



What are the new ventures you have in mind?

We are moving towards integrating our knowledge in tissue culture to raise better quality spices from which oils and oleoresins will be extracted.",1
796939,Scientists identify genes that can increase drought resistance in plants,"African ‘orphan’ crop varieties to help plants battle high temperatures

Orphan crops like finger millets have adapted themselves to grow in harsh weather conditions. Photo Wikimedia Commons

Scientists might have a solution to growing concerns of climate change hampering crop productivity. Researchers have identified genes in Africa’s local food crops that can improve resistance to drought. Incorporating these genes through hybridisation might improve crop yield that is affected by increasing global temperatures and heatwaves.

Countries like India and Pakistan are also likely to be affected by the prolonged heatwaves, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) estimated. The UN body is responsible for coordinating responses to environmental issues.

In May 2022, the central government of India revised the wheat production by 5.7 per cent to 105 million tonnes in the 2021-22 crop year. The previous projection was 111.32 million tonnes, but the crop productivity has been affected due to the early onset of summer, the department of agriculture and farmers welfare had said.

“Africa is estimated to help meet 25 per cent of the world population’s food needs by 2050,” said Sunil Kumar Sahu, Shenzhen-based research scientist at Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI), working on genome research. Sahu is also the internal project manager of the African Orphan Crops Consortium (AOCC), which works to address food security in the continent.

“Around two-thirds of global calories are derived from three crops mainly, rice, wheat and maise,” Sahu said, adding that Africa’s orphan crops remain less utilised.

Orphan crops are nutritious local food crops that could play a crucial role in combating hunger. These crops are not traded internationally but have adapted themselves to grow in harsh weather conditions.

Africa’s arid environment is not suited for crops like rice and maise. Orphan crops like finger millets, little millet, African yam bean, jojoba and jatropha are commonly found in the continent.

AOCC aims to sequence 101 such orphan crop species often neglected and under-utilised, said Sahu. “We have selected ten crops such as eggplant, breadfruit, jackfruit and moringa based on their nutritional value, productive capacity and adaptive abilities,” he added.

The consortium had identified genes that were high temperature tolerant, had increased salinity adaptability and had low water requirements that provided essential nutrition.

“For instance, jackfruit has a high starch value. Our jackfruit sequencing results identified a large expansion of genes related to sugar metabolism and starch, explaining their sticky characteristics,” said Sahu.

The fruit also stores a massive amount of energy and nutrition, including a range of vitamins and proteins. “Research shows that jackfruit also suits pre-diabetics and diabetics patients,” he said.

BGI, in collaboration with Huazhong Agricultural University, has developed a hybrid eggplant-tomato variety which allows a single plant to deliver both varieties. “Such methods can help improve agricultural productivity,” he said.

An enhanced version of perennial rice through crossbreeding techniques has also been developed. “The perennial rice allows you to harvest seeds multiple times as it grows back after harvesting. The variety can be harvested for up to five years, enabling more production with fewer labour costs,” Sahu further said.

These varieties have already been tried out successfully in African countries like Uganda.

Heatwaves and an overall increase in temperatures directly affect productivity by hampering pollination and a plant’s fertility, said Altafhusain Nadaf, a professor at the botany department of Savitribai Phule University in Pune. Nadaf is also working on developing resilient crop varieties.

Introducing tolerant genes to crops can increase their capacity to bear high temperatures, said Nadaf. “Adding these genes can increase the tolerance levels of plants to survive and deliver expected productivity,” he added.",1

Catering directly to the consumers’ needs assures better marketability and incomes. This is what nearly 10,000 farmers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have realised over the past decade and are now steering a silent organic movement.

It all began in 2009, when a group of consumers in Hyderabad, then part of unified Andhra Pradesh, established a cooperative society to source chemical-free produce directly from farmers.

Operating under the guidance of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), a Hyderabad-based research non-profit, the cooperative society over a period of time roped in a few farmers and began to sell the produce through a farmer-run retail store in Secunderabad and mobile retail vans that travelled to urban areas.

Soon, more and more organic farmers joined the cooperative society and what had started off as a consumers’ initiative became a farmers’ group. In 2013, when the government floated the concept of farmer producer organisation (FPO) to aggregate collection of produce and create market links for better prices under the Companies Act of 2013, CSA and the cooperative society saw this as an opportunity.

Establishing an FPO also helps gain financial support from the government. Thus, in 2014, all the farmers’ groups under the cooperative society registered themselves as organic FPOs, and the society at the helm as Sahaja Aharam Producer Company Limited, a unique “federation” of organic FPOs.

That was the year when Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh. But Sahaja Aharam continued its operation as a federation with FPOs from both the states. Today, as many as 23 organic FPOS with over 9,000 farmers across 180 villages are part the federation.

The groups are spread over the southern plateau and hills of Andhra Pradesh, as well as the north, central and southern parts of Telangana. The farmers grow paddy, cereals, oilseeds, pulses, fruits, vegetables and spices.

To obtain membership, FPOs buy equity in the federation. A board of five directors coordinates operations at the federation level along with the heads of the FPOs and support from CSA.

Market is key

Since inception, Sahaja Aharam has realised that there is a growing market for organic produce that can help farmers earn more. So it provides marketing and retail support for certified organic produce. Some of its member-FPOs, though, market both conventional and organic produce.

The federation also encourages and helps farmers to obtain organic certification and trains them on cultivation of specific crops; weed, pest and disease management; and preparation of organic and biological inputs. Some farmers are also trained in poultry and livestock farming.

Venkat Reddy from Kallem village in Jangaon district, Telangana, who has converted 1.2 hectares (ha) of his 6.07 ha farm to organic, said, “There was an initial loss in paddy yield after the shift, but the cost has reduced from Rs 25,000 per 0.4 ha to Rs 15,000. Currently, I grow organic paddy for my own consumption. But after seeing other farmers get 10-15 per cent more income from this variety, I plan to bring in more area under it.”

Regenerative or chemical-free cultivation has helped improve the local environmental conditions as well. Enabavi village in Telangana’s Hanamkoda district, which declared itself as the first organic village in the region in 2006 is now entirely free of pesticides, fertilisers and genetically modified crops.

All 52 farmer families of the village have shifted 110 ha to regenerative agriculture by composting organic waste, using cow dung manure and pest-trapping crops and harvesting water. “This has led to a rise in soil fertility,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of CSA.

With more farmers trying to benefit from regenerative agriculture, the federation is focused on helping its members gain a better market share. For this, it plans production strategies with its FPOs. It apprises them of trends in organic produce, sales figures and rates from the previous years.

“Unlike traditional FPOs, a lot of effort and business insight goes into production planning,” said Prasanna T P, chief executive of Sahaja Aharam. Further, to ensure quality, the federation tests 1 per cent of total produce for chemical pesticide residue.

“Sahaja Aharam buys my produce at 10-15 per cent higher price than the market,” said Vekanna Reddy, a farmer from Mulang village, Siddipet district, Telangana. The federation buys cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables and oilseeds at 10 per cent higher prices, which can increase based on quality. For paddy, rates can go higher.

The federation sells raw and processed products, which include food items, cosmetics and other non-food products. Some 45 per cent of the product range consists of organic fruits and vegetables. To set market prices, Sahaja Aharam follows two criteria.

First, the farmers’ share in the price must either be 50 per cent over the cost of cultivation, 12-15 per cent above the local market or 50 per cent of the average price in the previous year, whichever is highest.

For instance, it procures paddy crop from farmers at Rs 42 per kg and sells it for Rs 80 — cultivators earn more than half the retail price. Farmers are paid in two tranches, once during procurement and then after sale of products.

Second, to remain competitive, prices fixed by the federation are merely 15-20 per cent higher than those for conventional produce, but lower in comparison to those of some other organic players, particularly for pulses, groundnut oil and spices. Some 15 per cent of the price funds the federation’s operations.

For sales, the federation has expanded the retail stores. It now has two stores in Secunderabad and one each in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. Stores in Hyderabad and Secunderabad sell online as well. Their vans still operate in Hyderabad.

Sahaja Aharam also sells unlabelled produce in bulk to 110 aggregators. Currently, 55 per cent of sales are to bulk aggregators, 43 per cent through retail stores and 2 per cent online. Turnover has increased multifold over the last few years, from Rs 90.3 lakh 2018-19 to some Rs 2.61 crore in 2021-22.

Game-changer

The federation’s efforts to increase farm incomes go beyond market access.

“It has helped me re-learn sustainable farming techniques to increase yield. Earlier I used to earn Rs 29,600 per kg from paddy, now I earn Rs 33,000,” Krishan, a farmer from Jeedikal village in Jangaon district, who practices organic farming in his entire 2.8 ha, said. “I can save 50 per cent of cultivation costs, around Rs 10,000, by using organic inputs that I make,” he added.

The federation encourages farmers to grow traditional and new crops, based on water requirement, pest resistance, yield and market preferences. It also enables knowledge exchange and peer learning.

Further, it has introduced a mobile application called Pestoscope and set up surveillance centres in villages, and shares weather predictions from the India Meteorological Department and states. Sahaja Aharam also introduced an enterprise resource planning tool in 2018, developed by CSA, to manage production, finances, warehousing, sales and data analysis.

To diversify incomes and provide more livelihood opportunities, the federation has set up “food hubs” at six districts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for storage and processing. It is also diversifying its product range to include ready-to-eat and non-food products.

The federation provides several lessons on hand-holding support, storage, processing and marketing, however, like other FPOs in the country, it faces challenges such as poor financial support and lack of skilled humanpower. Addressing these hurdles will help it grow better.

798832,How 4 school girls are trying to get Andhra farmers to practise natural farming,"Zero Budget Natural Farming in Andhra Pradesh has helped farmers reduce input costs, thereby reducing debt

The message from four teenage girls from Hyderabad and Chennai is clear: There is a need to shift to natural farming.

Nandini Raju (16), Srilakshmi Reddy (16), Amrutha Potluri (16) and Sharada Gopalakrishnan (14) have been trying to get farmers to switch to Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF) for the last four months.

The farming method is based on the elimination of chemical inputs and use of locally available resources to reduce farmers’ input costs and make agriculture remunerative.

The girls, all of whom are studying, have made several videos on popular channel YouTube to educate farmers on the benefits of sustainable farming practices. The videos can be found on social media applications such as Instagram and Facebook too.

The girls have so far spoken to 40-50 farmers in Andhra Pradesh’s Guntur. Nilgari Foundation, a non-profit, helped them get in touch with farmers.

“We saw the news of a farmer from Telangana who lost his father to cancer some time ago. He wanted to convert to a healthier lifestyle. He now practises natural methods of farming and promotes it across the state. This only ascertained our belief in what we were doing,” said Raju.

The project, called Project Mritsa, is a part of the Purpose Academy, a program by 1M1B in partnership with the College of Engineering, Sutardja Center for Entrepreneurship and Technology at University of California, Berkeley and the Innovation Acceleration Group. 1M1B is a social innovation and future skills initiative aligned to the United Nations-mandated Sustainable Development Goals.

Big gains for Andhra farmers

Farmer distress, suicides and mass protests by farmers across India have been prompted by high production costs, unremunerative prices, depleting natural resources and the climate crisis. Andhra Pradesh is particularly impacted by the crisis.

The Government of Andhra Pradesh in 2018 launched a scale-out plan to transition six million farmers cultivating eight million hectares of land from conventional synthetic chemical agriculture to ZBNF by 2024. The aim is to make Andhra Pradesh India’s first 100 per cent natural farming state.

According to Raghuram Reddy, founder, Nilagiri Foundation:

Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are rich in fertile soil, which is best suited for farming. But due to the high cost of input, farmers are forced to take loans… As many as 90 per cent farmers are in debt in Andhra Pradesh, and each household bears an average debt of Rs 1 lakh. The cost of cultivation is lower in ZBNF for all crops; it ranges between Rs 3,000 and Rs 22,000 and the net revenue is higher by Rs 9,000-Rs 37,000 for all the crops because of the lower cost of cultivation.

Reddy added: “I saw my grandfather, a paddy farmer in a small village near Guntur, struggle to grow crops due to a huge pesticide invasion. He lost his savings in the process. The plight of farmers is similar. Our main idea is to promote sustainable agriculture through promoting organic farming, reducing cost of cultivation, producing residue-free commodities, promoting farmer producer ogranisations and helping procure and sale of farmer produce.

He added ZBNF has benefitted farmers by reducing their input costs, and thereby, reducing their debt. Farmers’ net revenue has increased.

“The ZBNF method also promotes intercropping, which helps farmers to grow more than one crop at a time. The impact of chemicals on the environment and on long term fertility of soil is devastating, but this has largely reduced in places where natural farming is being practiced,” he added.

‘Before it’s too late’

The girls are aiming to get in touch with 300 more farmers.

“The initial response has been excellent. Many farmers are happy to learn about sustainable and safer methods of farming,” said Srilakshmi Reddy.

She added the team is hopeful to take the project to a bigger stage: By making it easier for farmers to sell organic products through application as well as promoting the practise in more influential settings such as universities or schools.

“It is important to maintain balance between food security, environmental caution, farmers’ welfare and consumer satisfaction. Our vision is to help turn farming into a means of profitable livelihood instead of a means of bare subsistence,” said Potluri.

Gopalakrishnan said “serious problems just aren’t real to people until it’s too late. We hope to open people’s eyes to this.”",1
798867,New polyhouse technology to help cultivate off-season crops,"A polyhouse is a specially constructed structure like a building where specialised polythene sheet is used as a covering material under which crops can be grown in partially or fully controlled climatic conditions. It is covered with a transparent material as to permit the entry of natural light. Polyhouses are also helpful in reducing threats such as extreme heat and pest attacks in crops.

Harish Hirani, director of Indian Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute (CSIR-CMERI), Durgapur, recently inaugurated a “naturally ventilated polyhouse facility” and laid the foundation stone of “retractable roof polyhouse” its Ludhiana centre. With rapidly rising temperatures due to mounting greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities, crops are increasingly facing both threats — extreme heat and pest attacks — simultaneously, he said.

This is especially important for crops growing in the open field with no protection from the weather, and therefore its yield, quality, and crop maturity timings are changed. A combination of open field conditions and conventional greenhouse conditions is a more robust way to deal with climate change and associates problems in the future. Crop losses in India due to insect pests is about 15 per cent at present and this loss may increase as climate change lowers the plant defense system against insects and pests.

Conventional greenhouses have a stationary roof to reduce the effect of weather anomalies and pests. However, there are still disadvantages due to roof covering which sometimes lead to excessive heat and insufficient light (early morning). Besides this, they are also prone to insufficient levels of carbon dioxide, transpiration and water stress.

“Retractable Roof Polyhouse Technology will have an automatic retractable roof which will be operated based on weather conditions and crop requirements from the conditional database using PLC software. This ongoing development will be useful in our country with its 15 different agro-climatic zones and will help farmers to cultivate off-season crops that can fetch higher value and income”, Hirani said.

Jagdish Manikrao, a senior scientist leading the research team on the development of this technology, claimed the retractable roof would be used to manipulate sunlight quantity, quality & duration, water stress, humidity, carbon dioxide levels as well as crop and soil temperatures. (ISW)",1
798927,Indian research can help cut nitrogen fertiliser waste,"Indian scientists manage to identify phenotypes, visibly identifiable features that determine the efficiency with which cultivars use nitrogen

A group of Indian scientists have found a way to improve crops by reducing wastage of nitrogen fertilisers applied to them. They were able to identify phenotypes, or visibly identifiable features that determine the efficiency with which cultivated rice varieties (cultivars) use nitrogen.

This efficiency is known as nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE).

The group, lead by N Raghuram of Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, also identified genes associated with the identifiable features that can improve crops further.

The research involving interdisciplinary research in biotechnology, crop physiology, agronomy, soil science, statistics and bioinformatics was published in journal Frontiers in Plant Science January 20, 2021.

Crops generally use up 30 per cent of nitrogen fertiliser applied; the rest seeps into the environment, harming health and adding to climate change.

Agriculture leads to 70 per cent of nitrous oxide emissions in India. Of this, 77 per cent is contributed by fertilisers, mostly urea, according to the Indian Nitrogen Assessment published in 2017.

This greenhouse gas (GHG) is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. It has replaced methane as the second-largest component of GHG emissions from Indian agriculture in past 15 years.

Cereals consume over 69 per cent of nitrogen fertilisers in India; rice tops the list with 37 per cent, followed by wheat (24 per cent).

The scientists’ group compared three each of high- and low-NUE rice cultivars with normal or low doses of fertilisers like nitrate and urea as the sole nitrogen source. Nitrogen-use efficient cultivars tend to germinate and flower slower they found. Such varieties grow tall and deep, have a higher biomass and take longer for harvest; but they yield more on relatively less nitrogen.

The group also reported 34 genes associated with NUE for potential crop improvement. They evaluated 25 phenotypes for their nitrogen response using four different applications of the element.

“Many scientists described on one or two visible or phenotypic features that change in a plant in response to nitrogen-fertiliser, but nobody experimentally distinguished N-response from NUE,” said Raghuram, who chairs International Nitrogen Initiative (INI).

Crop-improvement mostly focuses on reducing crop duration and biomass to maximise output, he added:

Our work indicates that unless scientists bring NUE traits together with yield traits through breeding, we may be gaining yield at the cost of NUE. We also need to worry about whether this is also true for other inputs such as phosphorus, water, potassium, sulphur, etc.

India was the first country to study 25 phenotypic features in any crop, comparing different cultivars, nitrogen-forms and doses, said Narendra Sharma, the first author of the research paper. “We found that only 20 of them respond to nitrogen-fertiliser while only eight actually account for NUE.”

The findings in rice will be relevant for more cereals as well as other crops but need to be validated; the statistical and bioinformatic tools used can be also be used for difficult crop traits, he claimed.

“No one had clearly demonstrated how to deal with NUE when different forms of nitrogen-fertilisers are used. Scientific literature is dominated by developed countries that mostly use ammonium nitrate, while most developing countries use urea; we had to compare both,” said Vetury Sitaramam, who earlier taught biotechnology at University of Pune and is a co-leader of the study. According to him:

The discovery of the phenotype not only lays the foundation for crop improvement, but also for exciting research on the underlying mechanisms of NUE. We have already hinted earlier that respiration could play a crucial role in NUE but it needs to be investigated further.

NUE is calculated as a ratio between nitrogen used and harvest: A higher number denotes low wastage.

With the efficiency on the decline, farmers use more fertiliser in the hope of raising yield. This in turn worsens NUE.

As paddy consumes the most nitrogen fertiliser in India, any improvement in its NUE will be a win-win, said Tapan Adhya, former director of National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack and current co-director (science) of South Asian Nitrogen Hub project. He was involved in the research.",1
798951,Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2021: How poor regulation threatens aquaculture,"There are no regulations or institutional setup for freshwater aquaculture

Aquaculture is the world’s fastest-developing food production sector and represents an important impediment to food production. Fish are the most-traded food commodity in international trade with an export value of nearly $150 billion (around Rs 11.2 lakh crore).

The globalisation of aquatic animal products and the rise of aquaculture as a primary supplier of the world’s aquatic food supply have led to an intensification of culture practices. This has created new market opportunities for farmed aquatic animals but has simultaneously facilitated the easier spread of pathogens and diseases.

Diseases are a primary constraint to aquaculture and a variety of drugs are used to control the diseases. However, the imprudent use of these drugs in aquaculture is a contributing factor in the spread of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). Continuous use of antibiotics for alleviating bacterial diseases in aquaculture has led to ‘pseudo-durability’ and their omnipresence in the environment, which has caused the development of selective pressure on the microbial community.

Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) formed under selective pressure can develop into an environmental reservoir of antibiotic-resistant genes. Aquaculture systems and fish farms have been observed as the ‘hotspots for AMR genes’ and hence the assessment of resistome, the AMR gene assemblage in aquaculture, is an important topic of research worldwide.

Since the majority of antimicrobials used in aquaculture are also employed in human medicine, their use has a significant impact on the development of AMR in other ecological niches, particularly the human environment. Researchers have reported an increase in the frequency of serious infections and treatment failures as a result of antimicrobial resistance being transferred from aquaculture to humans through the consumption of aquaculture products.

Aquaculture in India, particularly shrimp and carp aquaculture, has been playing a significant role in the agriculture sector. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics are pervasive in both brackishwater and freshwater aquaculture.

The use of aquadrugs is common in major fish-producing states like Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. The use of antibiotics is slowly rising in states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.

There are standards, guidelines and an institution to manage the use of antibiotics and pharmacologically active substances in export-oriented brackishwater aquaculture. But there are no regulations or institutional setup for freshwater aquaculture, which account for two-thirds of India's fish production.

In other words, while we are protecting the health of our export customers, we have no concern for domestic consumers.

Besides food-fish production, antibiotics have got large scale applications in ornamental fish production. In recent years, the increased development of ornamental fish culture in many states has opened up problems of disease and water quality deterioration in ornamental fish.

Most of the ornamental fish varieties are normally procured from neighbouring Asian countries to India mainly through legal and illegal means. Ornamental fish have been the source of exotic bacterial and viral pathogens that have mandated strict quarantine regulations.

A wide range of antimicrobials have found their way into Indian ornamental fish culture since there are no strict guidelines in ornamental fish. Most of the aquaculture farmers are small-scale entrepreneurs with farm sizes less than two hectares. This creates a situation where the farmers may not be able to afford the investment needed to install biosecurity measures in farms.

Most of the shrimp farms get their seed from bio-secured hatcheries. However, several antibiotics are used at the time of transport with an erroneous assumption that they can reduce the mortality in seeds during transportation.



Poor regulation

A large part of the antibiotic use is not supervised by any scientific personnel and is generally based on the experience of fellow farmers. The policy of the European Union to reject consignments of shrimp, which has the presence of antibiotic residues has had a definite impact on the use of antibiotics in shrimp aquaculture.

The Marine Products Exports Development Authority is now conducting regular inspections of shrimp products, to ensure that it complies with export standards laid down by various international agencies. But this inspection is confined to the products meant for the export market and those meant for local consumption is largely unregulated.

Farmers have brought down the use of antibiotics through several biosecurity measures. There is very little antibiotic use in cage farming due to the complexity involved in administration. But in aquaculture farming other than shrimp, there is significant use of antibiotics. This is because the products are meant for local consumption and the market is highly unregulated.

In integrated farming, poultry waste and bird droppings are used as fish feeds. This gives rise to a peculiar situation in which there is antibiotic contamination of the aquaculture environment, even without direct use of antibiotics since poultry farming uses a high amount of antibiotics.

Vibrio bacteria has been isolated from coastal aquacultural areas showing a high prevalence of AMR. Aeromonas spp (species plural) depicting multi-drug resistance (MDR) have been isolated from the freshwater aquaculture systems.

The southern states of India, particularly the wetlands of coastal Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, are considered to harbour high levels of ARB. Two-thirds of the samples drawn from fish and shellfish obtained from the markets have Salmonella strains resistant to at least two antibiotics.

These results reflect the poor implementation of the existing legislative provisions, as well as the polypharmacy practised in the aquaculture sector. Such emerging AMR and MDR rates in India are an alarming situation.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has placed an extensive ban on the use of antibiotics and several pharmacologically active substances in fisheries. The long-term impact of the use of antibiotics for aquaculture not only has ramifications for the emergence of resistance in indigenous bacteria but also has a yet unmeasured impact on the ecology and the environment.

Due to the existence of stringent legislative provisions to contain the inappropriate and non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, it is expected that the problem of AMR in the aquaculture sector should be smaller compared to other sectors. However, the monitoring and implementation lack a roadmap, making it difficult to form a policy.

There is an absence of a ‘One Health’ approach to AMR containment at a policy level, as the focus is more on human health issues and the scope of the problem in the veterinary and aquaculture sectors, although acknowledged, is not outlined in granular details.

Few regulations and legislative measures are available against the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in food animals. Limited legislations are available for the control of antibiotics in the livestock sector, although some legislative tools are available for fisheries and poultry raised exclusively for export.

Improving hygiene, using enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics and acids to improve health and utilising bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophages as substitutes for antibiotics might be good methods to promote fish growth and decrease infectious diseases in them. As of now, stringent monitoring on antimicrobial use in Indian aquaculture is deemed necessary for the betterment of human health and aquaculture.

798953,"Organic farming can lead to good yields, even in an intensively farmed area","A survey in Haryana last year found that 45 per cent of 218 organic farmers got yields for wheat better than the state official average yield

The relative merit of organic farming is recognised. Still, it is usually recommended only for areas of low chemical usage and not for intensively farmed areas such as those where the Green Revolution took place in the 1960s like Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh.

The findings of various quarters, ranging from the Swaminathan Commission to the Indian Institute of Farming Systems Research under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), have showed that organic farming can give comparable yield.

Yet, these quarters hold on to this ‘niche role’ view on organic farming. The prime reason for this is the deeply-held belief that organic farming is basically low-yielding, in spite of merits like sustainability, health and environmental benefits.

A 2020 survey of farmers practicing organic farming in Haryana, a core area of the Green Revolution’, negates this. Only a telephonic survey was possible due to the raging novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Then too, only limited data could be collected in a telephonic survey.

Most farmers reported yield levels to be comparable even in the initial stages of transition. Hence, Kudrati Kheti Abhiyan, Haryana (KKA, translated as Natural farming Mission) collected yield data for just wheat as it had proved to be the most difficult crop to farm organically.

It was found that some 45 per cent of 218 organic farmers got better than official average yield for Haryana. Most organic farmers sow the C-306 variety of wheat, which is the preferred variety for domestic consumption in Haryana.

This variety, released by the ICAR, is considered to be a traditional one. It has an official average yield of 26 quintals per hectare (against the official average wheat yield for Haryana, which is slightly higher than 46 quintals).

Hence, two benchmarks were used in this survey — 26 quintals for traditional varieties, whether C-306 or others and 46 quintals for high yielding varieties (HYV) such as 711.

The value of companion crops at their respective Minimum Support Price (MSP) was converted to an equivalent wheat yield. Based on these calculations, it emerged that 45 per cent organic farmers were getting better than comparable average yields under chemical farming.

Even in terms of HYV alone, which is generally sown by new inexperienced organic farmers, some 18 per cent of farmers were getting better than the state average yield of wheat. Survey data from 2019 had, in fact, yielded better results though the total number of farmers was much smaller.

Why this difference?

What explains this difference between the popular perception about organic farming’s yield potential and the survey results? A part of the reason is the diversity in organic farming.

No use of artificial chemicals is an essential element of organic farming. Yet organic farming is not limited to this. ‘Comprehensive organic farming’ goes beyond the source of crop nutrition and involves multiple agronomical changes.

Often, even organic farmers take a narrow view of organic farming and continue with mono-cropping, conventional irrigation and composting methods, which are less-than-optimal.

Moreover, those organic farmers, who develop their own market, do not feel the need to increase the yield and rather focus on processing, packaging and marketing. Similarly, part-time organic farmers or those producing for self-consumption have no imperative to or are not able to increase yield.

The KKA situation was different. As the target area was spread all over the state, it was not possible to extend marketing support to thinly spread farmers.

Without marketing support, a livelihood farmer can expand organic farming beyond self-consumption only if there is no yield decline or it is so minimal that it is compensated by a fall in the cost of production.

Hence, if KKA had to make headway without extending marketing support, it had to perforce focus on getting comparable yield. Moreover, low-yielding organic farming, if accompanied by price premiums, can make organic farming attractive for individual farmers but it would not impress policy makers who have to ensure national food security.

However, initially, yield levels particularly in wheat, were pretty low. A review indicated that except for stopping the usage of chemical inputs and burning of crop residue, even serious organic farmers had made no changes in their agronomic practices.

They neither found it feasible nor necessary to stop mono-cropping or practice mixed green manuring, etc. However, during an ‘exposure visit’ outside Haryana in 2016, they found these measures being implemented and yielding results.

It was then that they started practicing ‘comprehensive organic farming’. And once their yield levels improved, other farmers too changed their organic practices.

For the same reasons which forced KKA to not extend marketing support, it focused on self-reliant organic farming rather than rely on external supply of bio-inputs.

As KKA was not functioning in a limited contiguous area but was thinly spread all over the state, it could not ensure regular supply of external bio-inputs to isolated farmers. Hence, it focused on in situ preparation of bio-inputs as well as use of only replicable methods.

Any method, which required heavy investment, was not recommended because it could not be easily replicated. This approach underlies the publication of a new edition of a manual of self-reliant organic farming edited by farmers wherein all recommended methods have been applied by Haryana farmers.

Will this success of organic farming in the core Green Revolution belt convince policy makers to mainstream organic farming? One is not sure.

In a September 2021 public hearing, when these survey results from Haryana were sought to be corroborated from the official yield data of the Government of India, the reaction of an official representative was revealing.

He thought that there had been a mix-up and yield levels pertained to hectares and not acres. This implied that correct yield levels were 40 per cent of the officially reported yield levels.

But agriculture scientists should not be presumptive. If the Haryana survey fails the strict ‘scientificity’ test (though it does not as survey data is widely used), they must get out and do their crop cutting experiments on the fields of organic farmers.

798968,Organic and conservation farming boost multifunctionality of ecosystems: Study,"Organic farming has a 46-51 per cent lower global warming potential

One of the main challenges facing agriculture is to produce sufficient food with minimal environmental impact.

Agricultural practices followed in conservation agriculture and organic farming — integrated plant protection, crop rotation and the use of organic inputs — helped in reducing the productivity-environmental protection dilemma, according to a study published August 20, 2021.

Organic farming also had a reduced environmental impact, with a 46-51 per cent lower global warming potential and an 80-85 per cent reduced aquatic ecotoxicity potential per hectare, the report said.

Agricultural practices influence a wide range of ecosystem functions and services. The study assessed the overall performance of important cropping systems in Europe within adapted ecosystem services and using the ecosystem multifunctionality — the ability of ecosystems to provide multiple functions and services simultaneously.

Researchers evaluated and compared the agronomic, economic and ecological performance of the arable cropping systems in Europe — organic, conservation and conventional agriculture. The results were published in the report titled Organic and conservation agriculture promote ecosystem multifunctionality in the journal Science Advances.

Nine agroecosystem goods and services were used in the study for multifunctionality assessments: Biodiversity conservation, soil conservation, erosion control, water and air pollution control, food production, income, work efficiency, and financial independence.

Conventional systems with intensive tillage showed improved performance and it can be explained by way of increased weed control and a better availability of applied nutrients.

Weed cover was six to nine times higher in the organic systems, whereas reduced and no tillage had a negative impact on summer crops like maize and beans, the study found.

The use of mineral fertilisers and herbicides in conventional systems led to higher yields for wheat and maize compared to organic systems. The differences between conventional and organic systems were less pronounced for legume crops like field beans and grass-clover ley.

The loss of productivity in organic systems did not mean reduced economic performance, as the highest income was obtained under organic production, according to the report.

Conservation agriculture (no tillage or reduced tillage) and organic farming positively influenced most soil quality variables.

Organic farming — and reduced tillage intensity in particular — had a positive impact on soil biodiversity and the abundance of macro- and micro-biota. Beneficial soil biota, such as earthworms and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, were promoted under organic management and conservation agriculture.

Soil fungi and bacteria responded positively to conservation tillage and was associated with soil carbon content increase, the research showed.

Organic management and conservation tillage significantly reduced sediment delivery and contributed greatly to soil protection.

An agricultural system should be able to provide the desired balance of services — food production, regulation services (soil, water and climate protection), supporting services (biodiversity and soil quality conservation) as well as providing for an ensured income and suitable working conditions.

The researchers used a six-year dataset from the Farming System and Tillage (FAST) experiment and compared the agronomical, ecological and economic impacts of four arable cropping systems — conventional intensive tillage, conventional no tillage, organic intensive tillage and organic reduced tillage.

Conventional no tillage and organic reduced tillage systems are considered to reflect conservation agriculture, as the three pillars of conservation agriculture — minimum tillage, six-year crop rotation and permanent soil cover with crop residues and cover crops — are largely fulfilled.

A study published in Agronomy for Sustainable Development December 18, 2018 demonstrated that both organic farming and conservation agriculture reduced soil losses and showed that reduced tillage practices was a major improvement in organic farming with respect to soil erosion control.

The largest adoption of conservation agriculture is seen in North and South America, followed by Australia and New Zealand, Asia, Russia, Ukraine, Europe and Africa, the researchers noted.

Organic farming is in a nascent stage in India (2 per cent of the net sown area) and states need to step up their act to increase organic farming coverage, Down to Earth reported in September 2020. A major part of the area under organic cultivation is concentrated only in a handful of states.

An increase in environmental benefits tends to be coupled with a decrease in productivity. Future studies should focus on main barriers limiting yield to reduce the gap between conventional and organic agriculture and enhance ecosystem multifunctionality, the report suggested.

The total area of cultivable land globally devoted to organic and no tillage systems are currently 1.4 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively. To increase environmental protection and delivery of supporting and regulating services, the total area for organic and no tillage systems needs to be substantially expanded.",1
799058,"Use revenue-sharing model for development, land acquisition","Access to village commons improved livelihoods but some recent state policies seek to grab them

Land, whether owned or operated, is an important asset in rural India. Apart from ensuring food security and social status of a household, its value improves the family’s access to several other resources like credit markets. Therefore, land has always been a source of political, social and economic power.

In Punjab, the battle by Dalit (scheduled castes) households, most of whom are landless, for access to village common land or panchayati land has been going on for quite some years now.

The Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961 states that of the cultivated land proposed to be leased out, 30 per cent, 10 per cent and 10 per cent respectively shall be reserved for the Scheduled Caste, the Backward Class and dependents of those killed in any war.

A cultivable land of 80 hectares or more can be also leased out up to five years without auction to the collective farming cooperative society of the village under the Punjab Co-operative Societies Act, 1961 with the approval of Zila Parishad.

Due to land rights movement, 44 village panchayats have allotted panchayat land to Dalits since 2014. In 2017-18 alone, 55,200 ha of panchayat land was leased out, accounting for 81 per cent of the total common land in the state.

Access to this common land led to a significant improvement in the livelihoods of landless households, especially women who worked as daily agricultural labourers earlier; most now grow their own food, rear livestock and sell milk.

But some recent state policies aim to grab this land from panchayats. The draft agricultural policy of Punjab (2018) states: “The Government shall make efforts… to promote climate resilient agriculture by ensuring that village common lands are used to provide required biodiversity to protect agriculture… Additionally, a biodiversity reserve of about one hectare will be planned in each village.”

In 2017, the government asked village panchayats to use one-third of the village common land for planting trees to increase green cover in the state which is only 4.85 per cent, besides generating employment under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.

While these policies were well intentioned, the Industrial and Business Development Policy-2017 proposed to take away panchayat lands for industry which is at cross purpose. It says the government will help identify and transfer common lands and unutilised government lands to the infrastructure development authority for setting up industrial parks.

The recent nod to amend the Village Common Lands Act proposes acquiring the common land for setting up a land bank for industrial projects.

This amendment would affect the income of panchayats that support local development work — land-generated income of panchayats across Punjab in 2016-17 was Rs 292.7 crore — and make them dependent on the Union and state governments, defying all the provisions about decentralisation.

It would also take away from the landless Dalit households their hard-earned access to common lands and the hope of getting it in many more villages across the state.

Even the Vidhan Sabha Committee report on farmer suicides did not pay attention to the issue of leasing of common land to the Dalit farm labour households.

Punjab is not alone in such anti-poor shift in policy. Earlier, Gujarat had handed over the ceiling surplus land, meant for the poor and marginal farmers, to the industry citing the need for land for industrialisation. The question that should be asked is: Why can’t a revenue sharing model be used for privately owned land for its use for industrial development, as has been done in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh instead of taking away the livelihoods sources of the most marginalised?

799079,Applying modern tech to agriculture,"Farmers today can use the benefits of the technological revolution to increase their yields from farming and livestock rearing

It is possible to monitor and control the irrigation of crops through a smartphone. Photo: Getty Images

Modern agriculture is driven by continuous improvements in digital tools and data as well as collaborations among farmers and researchers across the public and private sectors.

During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, India could achieve self-sufficiency in food grain production by using modern methods of agriculture like better quality of seeds, proper irrigation, chemical fertilisers and pesticides.

As time passed, more technological advances appeared in agriculture. The tractor was introduced, followed by new tillage and harvesting equipment, irrigation and air seeding technology, all leading to higher yields and improved quality of the food and fibre that was grown.

It is possible for farmers to utilise scientific data and technology to improve crop yields and keep themselves up-to-date with cutting edge methods of farming.

Here are some examples of how modern technology can be used to improve agriculture:

1. Monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems via smartphone

Mobile technology is playing an important role in monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems.

With this modern technology, a farmer can control his irrigation systems from a phone or computer instead of driving to each field.

Moisture sensors in the ground are able to communicate information about the level of moisture present at certain depths in the soil.

2. Ultrasounds for livestock

Ultrasound is not only for checking on baby animals in the womb. It also can be used to discover what quality of meat might be found in an animal before it goes to the market.

The testing of DNA helps producers to identify animals with good pedigrees and other desirable qualities. This information can also be used to help the farmer to improve the quality of his herds.

3. Usage of mobile technology and cameras

Some farmers and ranchers use apps like ‘Foursquare’ to keep tabs on employees. They also put up cameras around the farm.

Livestock managers are wiring up their barn feedlots and pastures with cameras that send images back to the central location like an office or home computer. They can keep a closer eye on the animals when they are away or home for the night.

4. Crop Sensors

Crop sensors help apply fertilisers in a very effective manner, maximising uptake. They sense how your crop is feeling and reduce the potential leaching and runoff into ground water.

Instead of making a prescription fertiliser map for a field before you go out to apply it, crop sensors tell application equipment how much to apply in real time.

Optical sensors are able to see how much fertiliser a plant may need, based on the amount of light reflected back to the sensor.

Vision about modern agriculture

Nearly everyone working on the future of modern agriculture is focused on efficiency. A wide range of technologies will enable the transition of modern agriculture in the field.

Some technologies will need to be developed specifically for agriculture, while other technologies already developed for other areas could be adapted to the modern agricultural domain such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and machine vision.

If modern agriculture is applied widely in the near future, millions of farmers will be able to benefit from the acquisition of real-time farm information.

Farmers need not spend significant amount of time on acquiring farm data and will have access to disaster warnings and weather information when a disaster event occurs.

It is difficult to predict the future of technology in agriculture but there are many promising trends and pilot projects.

799080,How big data can boost agricultural growth,"Data tools can help determine changes required to maintain yields and meet food demands

In agriculture, big data is often viewed as a combination of technology and analytics that can collect and compile novel data and process it in a more useful and timely way to assist decision making.

Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning statistics and database system.

Precision agriculture’s main objective is to ensure profitability, efficiency, and sustainability using the big data gathered to guide both immediate and future decision-making. This could cover everything — from when it is best to apply fertilizers, chemical and seeds, to from where in the field it is best to apply a rate.

According to agriculture funders, the big data practice comprises capturing relevant data from a huge number of sources, collecting it today and translating it into actionable information to improve business processes and solve problems at scale and speed.

Real-time insights to help performance optimisation advance analytics can show how farmers are utilising their inputs and what adaptations are required to take account of emerging weather events or disease outbreaks.

To achieve this, advanced algorithms are needed to swiftly unlock the highly valuable insights for products to perform well on an ongoing basis despite changing conditions. The development of highly-specific customer segmentation set has become possible to tailor product offerings to meet customer needs.

For instance, if Black Grass becomes problematic in a given region, suppliers can deploy big data techniques such as real-time micro-segmentation of customers to target promotional and marketing activities, thus facilitating better utilisation of marketing spends. Big data connectivity has proven itself a key asset for companies seeking a competitive advantage over their competitors.

Benefits include faster unearthing of valuable insights and the ability to develop and adapt products that meet specific customer needs on an ongoing basis.

Robots can play an important role in control, but it can be expected that the role of humans in analysis and planning is increasingly assisted by machines so that the cyber physical cycle becomes almost autonomous.

Considering its potential, various agri-tech companies are providing their services to the producers to make the practice more approachable and available. Hardware-wise there are various sensors collecting the available data.

In this range, we can encounter autonomous vehicle devices farmers place in the ground to measure soil moisture and nutrient, predictive weather stations and image-capturing satellites and drones mapping out land and measuring crop health.

These insights are extremely important since they tell the farmer when and how much to irrigate a field, crop health, weather predictions, pest infestations and even drought conditions. Considering the increasing labor shortages in the sector the capacity for big data analysis that lessens the need for physical manpower is of great advantage for agriculture.

Role of data analysis in agriculture

Application of science and new technologies is currently lacking within this space. Many companies and start-ups are looking to fill this information gap. If Big Data has made serious advancement in fields like information technology, healthcare, education and even sports, there is an obvious need for it in the agricultural industry too.

While the vast majority of farmers and ranchers did great work for maintaining and increasing soil health using conservation practices alone, measurement tools will be instrumental in ensuring a sustainable farming future.

To maintain yields and meet the food demands of a growing population while also protecting natural resources required, making additional changes and data tools can help determine what these changes should be.

The end result of gathering data is to analyse it and come up with actionable solutions with better results. For example, a satellite image of a plot of land has several layers of data embedded into a single spectrum giving us a tonne of information to analyse. The geospatial approach and satellite monitoring of farms have led to major advancement in how farmers and companies make their decisions.

Advantages of data analysis in agriculture

Data helps debt-laden farmers, insurance agencies, loan banks, seed companies, machine industry and every big and small player. Data analysis not only creates greater awareness and more accurate knowledge, but it can also plug the lacunae in the supply and marketing chain of the industry.

Information is power, and the industry can now have access to it for more informed decision making. These are the ways in which data analysis can help:

Development of new seed traits - Access to the plant genome with new ways to measure, map and drive information betters products.

Precision farming - Big data takes advantage of information derived through precision farming in aggregate over many farms. The resulting analytics, insights and better decisions can then be deployed through precision farming techniques

Food tracking - Use of sensors and analytics to prevent spoilage and food-borne illnesses

Effect on supply chains - Seismic shifts in the supply chain of seed, crop inputs and food driven by the democratisation of technology and information

The big data revolution is in its early days and most of the potential for value creation is still unclaimed. But it has set the industry on a path of rapid change and new discoveries. Stakeholders committed to innovation will likely be the first to reap rewards. If the farmers would have been concerned about the infirmities in terms of data-based farming, production could be increased.",1
799084,Dantewada’s organic farming model promising for sustainable livelihood,"The district also plans to support forest-based livelihood through DMF in the coming months

Ramjatan is happy and surprised with the improvement in his finger millet crop productivity this season. He is one of the many farmers in Behnar village (Nerli Gram Panchayat) of Dantewada district and other nearby villages who adopted the Sri Vidhi technique to grow millets this year. This is an initiative by Bhoomgadi Organic Farmers Producer Company (FPC), which was established by the district administration in 2016 using District Mineral Foundation (DMF) trust funds.

DMF is a non-profit trust set up under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2015, with the precise objective to “work for the interest and benefit of persons and areas affected by mining”. Among several socio-economic and human development issues of the mining-affected areas and communities that DMFs must address, the key matter is livelihood.

The Bhoomgadi Organic FPC is one such livelihood enhancing initiative that helps farmers affected by mining activities. Of the total 124 villages, where Bhoomgadi Organic FPC is working, 20 per cent are directly affected by mining.

Bhoomgadi works on registered membership. A total of 2,700 farmer members are currently registered with the FPC as shareholders. Further, as the FPC procures various agricultural produces from local farmers, it indirectly benefits many more farmers other than just the registered members. According to Bhoomgadi, around 10,000 farmers are directly or indirectly benefitting from it.

Bhoomgadi helps farmers at various stages — from sowing, to procurement of crops and marketing of products. It also operates an organic processing unit and has its own godown. The processing unit and godowns have been established using DMF funds. Besides, it has taken a Rs 53 lakh interest-free loan in the form of revolving fund and has to repay it in 10 years.

“The initiative is also targeted to create local ownership and a self-sustaining system,” said Akash Badave, CEO of Bhoomgadi Organic FPC. For this, the company is nurturing a cadre of Jaivik Karyakartas who help farmers adopt organic methods of cultivation.

In the coming days, the district intends to further extend the Bhoomgadi’s operation beyond agricultural products and include support for minor forest produces as well. This way, the forest dependent communities can also be supported through such initiatives.

Bhoomgadi is an important initiative to enhance local resource-based livelihood. In districts like Dantewada, which have various local grains and a variety of minor forest products, such initiatives are important in creating sustainable livelihood opportunities for local communities. Such livelihood enhancement initiatives are also more appropriate for tribal communities — 70 per cent of Dantewada’s population.

The Chhattisgarh government is also taking significant measures and is currently trying to amend the State DMF Rules to put more emphasis on livelihood enhancement, include forest-based livelihood, and identification of mining-affected people.

799091,Doha Model shows how to rein in water for irrigation,"In spite of its challenges, digging of streams and creation of pond-like structures along their length can provide farmers with the much needed source of irrigation

Mandla and Dindori districts in southeastern Madhya Pradesh have a highly undulating topography, covered by large tracts of forests. Scheduled Tribes (STs) form more than half of the total population in both the districts, with agriculture as their mainstay.

Mandla and Dindori receive more than 1,200 mm of annual rainfall but, the percentage of the net sown area under irrigation, for both the districts, is among the lowest in Madhya Pradesh.

Mudadih Raiyat, a small village in the Mandla district, has around 56 households, 95 per cent of which belong to the STs as per 2011 Census.

More than half of the village households have their agricultural fields in the vicinity of an ephemeral stream — their only source of irrigation — recharged by the monsoon rainfall.

People use electric pumps to draw water from the stream to cultivate paddy in Kharif season and wheat in Rabi season. However, Jugraj Singh Pandre (35) says that until a year ago, the shallow stream would dry in the middle of the Rabi season — between November and December.

A drying stream would lead to wheat crop failure, and the few open wells in the village do not have the capacity to supplement irrigation.

Improved agriculture through stream digging

During the summer and winter of 2018, as part of a water harvesting programme, several 100-feet-long and 10-feet-deep pond like structures known as ‘Doha Model’ were dug along the length of the village stream. These were dug by deepening the stream and creating earthen bunds between every two such structures.

Farmers claim that these structures have arrested the flow of rainwater in the stream, which would otherwise gush through the undulating terrain. Post-monsoon too, the Doha Model structures tapped into the sub-surface water which would otherwise flow downstream. Thus, water retention in the stream has increased significantly.

Kunnilal Pandre (55), a farmer from Mudadih Raiyat, cultivated coriander in January this year on one of his agricultural plots, which he irrigates using the Doha Model. Another farmer, Shiv Shankar Pandre (32), cultivated wheat over a four-acre land patch which would stay fallow during Rabi until last year.

Close to a dozen households, having their agricultural fields in the vicinity of the stream, feel that they can irrigate their Rabi crops better with the Doha Model. Jugraj adds that the additional stream water is a boon for their cattle in the scorching summer heat.

Fatehpur village in the neighbouring Dindori district, situated on highly undulating terrain and comprising around 100 predominantly ST households, has similar agricultural practices.

At least three fourth of the households have their agriculture lands in the vicinity of a stream, which is the only source of irrigation.

In the summer of 2018, members of the Laxmi women self-help group (SHG), with the help of NGO Action for Social Advancement (ASA), ensured digging of the stream to create Doha Models and prolong the stream water retention. In the same year, post-monsoon, people reported a significant increase in water retention.

Santi Bai (35), a member of the Laxmi SHG, says that because of Doha Models, water in the stream was sufficient to irrigate the wheat crop during Rabi.

Kunwar Singh Tekam (50) recounted digging out certain pockets in the stream for Rabi irrigation, which is not required now. Arjun Mandavi (30) shares that this intervention has benefitted more than half of the agricultural fields in the vicinity of the stream.

Challenges and way ahead

Despite their immediate visible benefits, there are specific challenges to the digging of streams. Pond-like structures on the flowing water streams are prone to continuous silting, particularly on the undulating terrains in Mandla and Dindori, thus making the structures short lived.

Sharad Mishra from ASA, Mandla, said the assumed lifetime for these structures, with no maintenance, is four to five years. To keep the Doha Models functional for long, water-user groups are a potential solution.

In Mudadih Raiyat, multiple water-user groups have been formed, with one group comprising households using water from one Doha Model being solely responsible for its maintenance, including periodic desilting. However, most water user groups are yet to be tested.

Another concern is the long-term, basin level impact of tapping into the sub-surface water flow. A detailed study is required to ascertain what, if any, are its positive or negative implications at the basin level.

In spite of its challenges, digging of streams and creation of pond-like structures along their length can provide farmers with the much needed source of irrigation, especially in high annual rainfall and undulating regions like Mandla and Dindori. Moreover, if, combined with the soil conservation measures upstream, these structures can stay functional for long.",1

12 August 2020, Saskatoon: MustGrow Biologics Corp. announces successful proof-of-concept for its proprietary biological non-selective bio-herbicide, based on MustGrow’s signature mustard-derived approach to controlling unwanted pests and diseases.

Read: Bayer and Temasek unveil innovative new company focused on developing breakthroughs in vertical farming

MustGrow’s bio-herbicide internal work has focused on the pre-plant application of our natural mustard-based technology on small weeds and weed seeds. Observations showed 100% kill of weeds, killing the plant from the roots up compared to the untreated control weeds – confirming previous third-party trials.

Natural Defence Mechanism

The length of control was recorded and has potentially demonstrated control of the weed seeds themselves. This continues to validate MustGrow’s natural science-based approach, utilizing the mustard seed’s natural defence mechanism not only as a bio-pesticide, but now also as a bio-herbicide. MustGrow is now in the process of running larger trials to reconfirm the efficacy, application rates and length of control. The Company anticipates further trial results before the end of 2020.

“The developing characteristics of our active ingredient as a non-selective bio-herbicide represent a key application of our remarkable natural mustard-based technology,” remarked MustGrow CEO Corey Giasson. “We are excited to potentially provide a natural solution for not only farmers but for home and garden use as well.”

In early 2020, MustGrow completed a series of application rate tests with Canada’s National Research Council to determine the applicability of MustGrow’s natural mustard-derived technology. Using multiple application methods, herbicidal control was achieved after only 72 hours – killing the trial plants from the root up. With this supportive data, MustGrow filed patents for method-of-use and composition-of-matterclaims for a non-selective bio-herbicide.

31 May 2021, EU: The food produced in the EU is recognised for being safe, nutritious and of high quality. With the Farm to Fork and Biodiversity Strategies, the Commission has set out its ambition to position the EU as the gold standard for environmental, social, and economic sustainability at global level. The co-signing associations of the agri-food value chain support this ambition; in fact, we believe in many cases, our sectors already are the global gold standard.

Also Read: HarvestPlus in Uganda: 16 Years of Innovation to Improve Nutrition and Health

The co-signing organisations, which are members of the Agri-Food Chain Round Table on Plant Protection and whose logos are included on top of this communication, call on the Commission to take into consideration the following points:

The need to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the cumulative economic, social and environmental impacts of the various targets for EU agriculture set out in the Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity Strategies before taking any political or binding regulatory decisions. This is critical to identify areas for which urgent action, accompanying measures or support are needed.

The targets proposed should not only be coherent and consistent across the European Green Deal initiatives, but also useful, measurable, realistic and achievable.

The targets should be science-based, technically feasible and economically sustainable to enable the long-term economic viability and competitiveness of all players in the food supply chain.

In order to deliver on the ambitious Green Deal objectives, any proposed combination of policy measures needs to balance trade-offs without leaving anyone in the food supply chain behind – especially in the aftermath of COVID-19. This means that the policy options under consideration need to be science-based and premised on solid data. This is too important an issue for there not to be a full assessment of the potential consequences.

Recognising what has already been done…

The co-signers believe that it is important to recognise what has already been delivered by EU supply chain stakeholders in terms of the sustainable use of pesticides.

In Europe, pesticide use and risk has decreased sharply over the past 50 years. Thanks to innovation in agriculture, the average use rate of active ingredients per hectare for herbicides, for instance, has dropped by 97%[1]. Ultimately, over the past 60 years, the average use rates of newly introduced active ingredients have been reduced[2]. Currently less than 470 active substances (including 29 low-risk active substances and 23 basic substances[3]) are available on the market to protect our crop and plant production.

All the substances on the market are assessed and approved to counter real, documented pest pressure and plant disease needs. Besides, they are always assessed not to present any unacceptable risk to human health or the environment according to the conditions of use, before being put in the market.[4]

What still needs to be done?

To achieve the targets and fulfil the objectives set in the Farm to Fork Strategy, producers need to have enough safe, effective and affordable tools at hand to ensure food security and sustainable production, including biocontrol technologies, crop rotation systems, digitalisation methods, New Genomic Techniques and resilient varieties for EU crops and plants.

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) itself uses chemicals only as the last resort, as described in the EU Sustainable Use Directive 128/2009. While the reduction in conventional pesticide use is of course positive, it also means that producers have fewer tools at their disposal to combat changing production conditions. It is therefore critical that a policy framework is put in place that supports crop protection needs through an appropriate combination of existing and emerging technologies/opportunities. We call on the EU Institutions to further enlarge the risk analysis paradigm for crop protection using a more holistic approach, and to therefore have it include the science-based risk assessment and the socio-economic impact assessment.

Lower risk crop and plant protection alternatives must be effective, affordable and safe and be able to get onto the EU market more efficiently. This would equip farmers, and farm advisers, with the tools needed to fully implement IPM schemes, which, in turn, will support the use of effective, affordable and safe crop protection alternatives.

Nevertheless, despite the EU food chain’s interest, in particular that of primary producers, in applying low-risk PPPs and other sustainable technologies, such products are often still not readily available. There are many issues that we can highlight with the status quo: slow authorisation procedures; authorisation of products with lower efficacy; slow innovation progress; lack of mutual recognition; high cost-effectiveness ratios; a lack of affordability and accessibility for farmers.

Answers to the challenges that lie ahead require substantial investments in research, innovation and in the development of new tools throughout the agri-food chain. It is therefore essential that we keep investments flowing into this area to bring to the market effective, affordable and safe plant protection alternatives and technologies that are well adapted to the EU agricultural system and circumstances. For this to happen, the policy framework needs to be adapted. This includes adopting a horizontal EU innovation framework.

In addition to this, we believe that the EU institutions should advise farmers to and reward those who go the extra mile in terms of the sustainability of their crop protection systems, while ensuring profitability for the agricultural and rural community as a whole.

With regard to the impact of these targets in international trade, we have to bear in mind that goods imported into the EU also form an essential part of the agri-food chain. Moreover, it is in the EU’s interest that other producing countries interested in continuing their trade relations with the EU also have the possibility to adapt to these requirements without upsetting the balance of international trade. We call on the Commission to consider a realistic time frame before making any legislative decision or change in the near future.

Furthermore, to properly deliver on the objectives of the Green Deal this transition to more sustainable crop protection systems should be accompanied by efforts to ensure adequate Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) eco-schemes.

Last but not least, we also regret the fact that there is not yet a common EU approach – not even in the Farm to Fork Strategy – to support the important niche market that is the production of speciality crops. These types of production also lack tools to protect their crops, which has a considerable impact on these sectors. It would certainly be useful to also improve the procedures relating to the use of present and future tools for speciality crops.

Therefore, the co-signing organisations remain committed to an ongoing structured dialogue between the European Commission, Member States and EU food chain actors. Such dialogue has never been so essential as we try to attain the ambitious Green Deal targets. We need to identify and address the cross-cutting challenges and trade-offs together. Furthermore, these targets should pay particular attention to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, while preserving ecosystems and increasing the resilience of our EU food system.

The co-signing organisations listed above trust that the ideas and proposals outlined in this letter will be taken into account, and remain at the Commission’s disposal to collaborate further on the implementation of the Farm to Fork and the Biodiversity Strategies.",1
799293,India cannot afford organic farming,"S K SINHA national professor at the Water Technology Centre, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, spoke to Manish Tiwari on food security and the future of chemical agriculture in India

Can foodgrain production in India be increased further?

I see no reason why foodgrain production in the country cannot be increased. To think that only Punjab represents the entire country, is wrong. In many areas foodgrain production can be increased by using increased inputs, like fertilisers. We tend to compare the foodgrain production of India with other countries like China. But the amount of fertiliser being used by farmers in China exceeds the amount used in India. For example, the average use of fertilisers in India is around 69 kg per hectare, whereas farmers in China use an average of 366 kg per hectare.



What is the future of chemical farming in India?

There are many areas in India where foodgrain production has not increased even with the use of such inputs. In many countries such as Japan, farmers use around 300 to 400 kg of fertiliser per hectare. It is another matter that climatic conditions in India are very different from Japan. However, such high levels of fertilisers must not be used to increase production. But I do not think that we will ever reach a level where we have to use 400 kg of fertilisers per hectare. But I do believe that even if we use an average of 80 kg per hectare under the prevailing climatic conditions, we will be able to increase our food production.



Can genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) meet the food demand in Asia, particularly in India? Why are people so apprehensive about GMOs?

We must not confuse ourselves by linking the issue of food security with gmo s. How many crops are being grown at present in the world that have been genetically modified? There are only certain crops that are genetically modified such as cotton, soybean and tomatoes. There is still nothing worth talking about gmo s with regard to wheat. There has been some research on rice. At present, not many gmo s have reached the field level.I do not think that gmo s will change the situation of foodgrains in India in another 10 years.



We should not lay too much emphasis on this issue at the cost of other pressing matters. For instance, farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa, are yet to adopt the available technologies in the country. If these technologies are put to use, production in these states will double. But this is not happening. If farmers do not adopt the available technologies, how can we expect them to accept gmo s so readily. I think some organisations may benefit by properly marketing gmo s around the world. However, with cotton and vegetables we need gmo s to reduce the use of pesticides.



With the economy becoming stronger people tend to shift to meat eating. It requires a lot of grain to feed livestock. Therefore, will a change from vegetarian to non-vegetarian food habits affect our foodgrain consumption?

I do not think people in India will ever prefer non-vegetarian food over vegetarian food. In the us and in Europe, people prefer to eat beef and pork. But religion and cultural backgrounds prevent Indians from doing so. Indians are not fond of non-vegetarian food. At best they eat chicken. We did a survey of passengers travelling by Indian Airlines. These were people who could afford non-vegetarian good. But a very large percentage had opted for vegetarian food.



What is wrong with our foodgrain management policy?

The World Food Summit held in 1996 in Rome said there is more than enough food being produced in the world to feed the entire population. Still around 800 million people go hungry. The issue of distribution needs to be managed properly. Today, what is essentially being distributed is the poverty. Even our economists come out with different definitions of poverty. And we are lost in the numbers game. Last year, many economists said that around 40 per cent of India's population are living under the poverty line. Now they are saying that the figure has dropped to 30 per cent.



Can a complete switch to organic farming help us improve the food situation?

I do not think that organic farming in India will ever pick up. We will have to first find out about the sources of organic materials. Whether it is cowdung, organic waste or something else. This is a nice idea, but it is very difficult to implement. There are many countries that can adequately meet their foodgrain requirements. So they can afford to use organic farming. However, we cannot afford to completely bank on organic farming.



Can excessive use of pesticides harm the environment?

Pesticides were allowed in the country to increase foodgrain production. Farmers started using pesticides because they found them useful. Pesticides are being used mostly on cotton, plantation crops and vegetables. But we need to reduce the use of pesticides. It is for this purpose that gmo s should be developed to reduce the use of pesticides. One cannot rule out the use of pesticides in the country if we want to meet the growing food demand.



What do you think is the best way to increase foodgrain production in India without putting too much pressure on the environment?

When people talk about foodgrains, they think they are only talking about food. In fact, the country requires around 250 million tonnes of vegetables and fruits annually. So the real question is how efficiently we can increase our food production, and not foodgrains alone.",0

26 December 2020, New Delhi, IN: A total of Rs 1 lakh crore worth of biofuel will be purchased every year by oil marketing firms in the future for blending. This money will be ploughed back to the rural economy

India currently consumes only one-third of the global average consumption of energy. As we move towards more robust energy consumption figures, the country faces the unique challenge of fusing together disparate needs: A ballooning appetite while cutting dependence on imports; greening the grid while ensuring affordability; and replacing old forms of energy production while boosting employment, and the human and economic capital of the people. Then there’s the fact that the energy sector is closely intertwined with issues related to climate change.

Needless to say, a vigorous ideation needs to undergird such energy transitions. The question is particularly cardinal for the sector I am in charge of: Petroleum and natural gas. We import about 84% of our oil and 56% of our gas for domestic use — and this in itself tends to negate the deliverables — delineated above — that we aspire to achieve.

In this context, biofuels have become a tool for achieving these delicate balance of outcomes. In the past few years, progress made in the use of ethanol, compressed biogas and biodiesel — all different forms of biofuel — will have a direct positive impact on both farm incomes (and the prosperity of agricultural communities), even as it cuts down our import dependence for energy.

Currently, the aim is to achieve 10% ethanol blending in petrol by 2022 and 20% blending by 2030 — something that will cut down carbon emissions in vehicles.

In 2019, in a first for the Republic Day parade, the Indian Air Force flew aircraft in a Vic formation, with the lead plane using a mix of traditional fuel and biofuel, symbolising the government’s determination to seek alternative sources of fuel. The primary raw material for ethanol production in India is sugarcane and its by-products, accounting for more than 90% of fuel ethanol supplies under the ethanol blended petrol (EBP) programme of the ministry. This programme injects liquidity into the stressed sugar sector and provides an alternative revenue stream to farmers. This programme also encourages diversion of sugarcane for ethanol production, which results in a decrease in the sugar glut in the country.

Ethanol supplies have improved from 380 million litres in 2013-14 to 1.89 billion litres in 2019. Offers of about 3.5 billion litres from both sugar/molasses and grain-based distilleries are expected this year. In addition to sugarcane, ethanol is also produced from damaged food grains, B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice. This translates into a sum of nearly Rs 35,000 crore in the past six years — money that has flown back to farmers through sugar mills and distilleries as oil marketing companies (OMCs) provide off-take guarantee at fixed prices. This arrangement also improves the health of the payment cycle to farmers since OMCs settle their ethanol dues to distilleries in 21 days instead of the months that the farmers had to wait for their payment from sugar mills.

The recent decision to utilise surplus rice available with the Food Corporation of India and maize as an additional source of feedstock for ethanol production, starting this year, means farmers will now have an alternative market for their produce.

With regards biodiesel, the National Policy on Biofuels in 2018 targets 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel by 2030. The policy encourages setting up of supply chain mechanisms for biodiesel production from non-edible oilseeds, used cooking oil and short-gestation crops. These crops can be easily cultivated in various states on land that is barren or not fit for edible crops, thus boosting farm incomes. Biodiesel procured by OMCs for blending high speed diesel has increased from 11.9 million litres in 2015-16 to 105.5 million litres last year.

The Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme launched in October 2018 aims to establish an ecosystem for production of compressed biogas (CBG) from various waste biomass sources in the country. Under SATAT, 5000 CBG plants with a total production capacity of 15 million metric tonne per annum (MMTPA), which is equivalent to 54 MMSCMD of gas by 2023, has been planned. This initiative offers a potential for investment of about Rs 1.75 lakh crore, generating about 75,000 direct employment opportunities.

Many of the proposed plants will use crop residue such as paddy straw and biomass as feedstock for production of CBG, especially in Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. The SATAT scheme will not only stanch greenhouse gas emissions, but will reduce burning of agricultural residue, which results in significant air pollution in cities like Delhi, generate employment in rural and waste management sectors, and boost income for farmers from their unutilised organic waste. One of the byproducts of CBG plants is biomanure, which can be used in farming.

The components of a biofuel supply chain create a circular rural economy that results in substantial environmental, socio-economic and health benefits for communities. A total of Rs 1 lakh crore worth of biofuel will be purchased by OMCs every year in the near future for blending. This money will be ploughed back to the rural economy, thus doubling farmers’ incomes. Keeping in mind international climate commitments and domestic requirements, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s emphasis has been on energy availability, accessibility and affordability; efficiency in energy use; energy sustainability; and energy security for mitigating global uncertainties. The quest, therefore, has been to shift the perception and the functioning of my ministry from one focused on international trade to one that strengthens the human development indices of the poorest standing in the queue.",1
796475,The Role of Drone technology in Indian farming and agriculture,"Share this

Guest author: Mr. Anuj Kumbhat, Founder & CEO, WRMS

20 October 2022, New Delhi: 18% of India’s GDP is contributed by the agricultural industry. We still needs to increase productivity and efficiency of the agriculture industry to bring it at global level. There are a number of aspects and issues that need to be recognised, supported, and addressed with right solutions.

Mr. Anuj Kumbhat, Founder & CEO, WRMS

Currently, inappropriate techniques are used for a wide range of critical farming activities, including crop monitoring, irrigation, pesticide application, and many others. The return on investment often declines because resources are insufficient, are not allocated according to weather conditions, or are not fully utilised.

Multiple opportunities for technological advancement have been made possible by such limitations. Since its inception, technology has always had a positive impact on the agricultural industry. The need to tackle some challenges became more pressing as governments and businesses nationwide realised the importance of food security and the effects of environmental deterioration, pollution, and water scarcity.

What role do drones play in Indian agriculture?

Considering its diversity and potential for the agrarian community’s future, drone technology has been the focus of industry’s attention. Drones encourage farmers to overcome other obstacles and profit greatly from precision agriculture and improve overall performance. The market for agricultural drones has grown to a staggering $1.3 billion, and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) fill the gaps left by traditional farming systems’ human error and inefficiency. Drone technology is being used to eliminate all ambiguity and guesswork and instead concentrate on precise and trustworthy information.

In farming, external factors like weather, soil properties, and temperature are crucial. The data collected by drones help to regulate crop health, crop treatment, crop scouting, irrigation, and carry out field soil analysis and crop damage assessments. The drone survey helps boost crop yields and minimises time and expenses.

Drones can be used to carry out a number of agricultural tasks like spraying pesticides, assessing soil health, crop nutrition, monitoring and analysing field moisture, etc.

It is anticipated that by 2050, there will be 9 billion people in the world. Additionally, it is estimated that agricultural consumption will rise concurrently by around 70%. Because of its benefits, drone technology that includes AI, ML, and remote sensing capabilities is becoming more and more popular.

Drones can help farmer in monitoring irrigation, surveillance of crop health, crop damage analysis, analysis of soil health, planting seed pods, agrochemical spraying, livestock tracking.

The farmer as a result of the above activities through drones will be able to achieve higher production, can safely use chemicals, have a quick decision-making process through available data, reduced resource wastage and get insurance claims in favour.

Agricultural drone technology will shape the future of India’s rural population without a doubt. It can alter conventional farming practices in countless ways. Although it takes more effort to become comfortable with this technology, once it starts, it will pay off in a short time.

19 October 2022, New Delhi: Taking major policy initiatives for Agriculture Startups, the Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Mr. Narendra Singh Tomar made several key announcements. In the Agri Startup Conference organized on the second day of PM Kisan Samman Sammelan at Pusa Mela Ground, Delhi, Mr. Tomar informed that a high-level steering committee will be constituted under the chairmanship of Agriculture Minister for overall guidance of the Agriculture Startup ecosystem. A Rs. 500 crore accelerator programme for taking forward and popularizing the successful initiatives of Agri Startups will be started.

Amidst a large gathering of Agri Startup delegates, Mr. Tomar announced that an Executive Committee would be constituted under the chairmanship of Secretary Agriculture, comprising of concerned agencies like DARE, DPIIT, agricultural incubators and knowledge partners, agricultural universities, research institutes, top investors and other stakeholders. Also, a separate Division will be created under the chairmanship of Joint Secretary for Agriculture Startups in the Ministry of Agriculture. A cell will also be created to work as a single window agency for Agri Startups to facilitate all linkages required with certification agencies, financial institutions, agricultural universities etc.

Mr. Tomar informed that a marketing linkage will be created with organizations like e-NAM and NAFED to meet the market needs of the products developed by the Agri Startups. A portal will also be developed to create a database for all Agriculture Startups and monitor their development. He said that efforts will be made to organize Agri Startup Conclave at national and regional level to promote Startups in Agriculture sector.

Eight years ago there were only 80-100 Agricultural Startups. At present, their number is more than 2,000, out of which hundreds of them have been provided training and financial assistance under the scheme of Ministry of Agriculture. The target of the Central Government is to take this number to 10,000.

796650,Organic fertiliser: A must for the next green revolution,"With the right policy interventions, India can become the hub of organic fertiliser production

India's growth story on the path of economic reforms has transformed the country into one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.

Despite having an enormous opportunity, India has been unable to capitalise on its strengths.

The central government has announced schemes worth crores for various sectors. Similar steps need to be undertaken for the organic fertiliser industry, as India has the potential to become the hub of organic fertiliser production in the world.

Organic fertiliser can be categorised into two segments, according to government rules: Bio-fertiliser and organic manure.

Bio-fertilisers are composed of living microorganisms attached to solid or liquid carriers and are useful for cultivable land, as these micro-organisms help in increasing the productivity of soil and / or crops.

Organic manure, on the other hand, refers to partially decomposed organic matter like digestate from a biogas plant, compost and vermicompost, which provides nutrients to the soil / crops and improves yield.

India produces more than 150,000 tonnes of municipal solid waste (MSW), based on estimated MSW generation data from the National Solid Waste Association of India and the Central Pollution Control Board.

Considering collection efficiency of 80 per cent and organic part of MSW to be 50 per cent, total organic waste generated per day in India comes to around 65,000 tonnes per day.

Even if half of this is diverted to the biogas industry, the government can leverage this by reduction in import of fossils and fertilisers.

Biogas / gobar gas plants not only produces biogas but also organic fertilisers. There is also great value in the organic fertiliser also known as digestate, which is the biogas plant's effluent.

Biogas can be utilised for heating, electricity and even vehicular purposes (after upgrading), whereas digestate can help realise the vision to have a second green revolution.

Digestate can provide organic carbon to the continuously depleting soil, apart from its standard nutrition value. In India at present, bio-fertiliser production is just over 110,000 tonnes ( carrier-based 79,000 tonnes and liquid-based 30,000 tonnes) and 34 million tonnes of organic manure, composed of farmyard manure, city compost and vermicompost, among others.

The organic manure (digestate) from a biogas plant can be applied at the rate of around 40 tonnes per hectare of cultivable land.

The penetration of organic fertilisers is low: The proportion of organic fertilisers of the overall fertiliser consumption was only 0.29 per cent for 2018-19 and 0.34 per cent for 2019-20. With promotion of biogas production, the government can reap the benefits of its bi-product — fertiliser.

The Centre has shown the intent of promoting the industry through its SATAT scheme. It has no doubt allocated 468 crores towards Central Financial Assistance in the earlier budget. But the industry needs much more support to save the future governments billions of dollars, because if all the projects applied under SATAT scheme materialise, it will help the country save $16 billion year-on-year.

Bio-compressed natural gas (bio-CNG) and solid organic manure or digestate can be produced in large quantities under the SATAT programme, under which more than 5,000 projects have been targeted across the country by the industry.

Thus, considering 8,000 kilogram / day of bio-CNG (one tonne of CNG can cater to 100 vehicles to run 250 kilometre per full tank of 10 kilogram at the rate of 25 kilometre / kilogram) and 27 tonnes / day of solid organic manure per plant with average plant size assumed to be 8 tonnes per day, it was estimated that 50 million tonnes per annum of solid organic manure / digestate will be generated in India once these projects are installed.

The popularity of organic farming has grown in the domestic market in recent years. The market size for Indian organic packaged food is expected to grow at a rate of 17 per cent and cross Rs 871 million by 2021.

The significant rise of this sector is linked to growing awareness about the harmful effects of synthetic fertiliser on soil, rising health concerns, expanding urban population base and an increased consumer expenditure on food goods.

Because organic manure can be improved with the use of bio fertilisers to meet nutrient requirements, both bio fertilizers and organic manure have the potential to eliminate the usage of synthetic fertilisers completely.

796657,How to replace chemical fertilisers with organic & bio-fertilisers,"Organic and bio-fertilisers should also be made suitable for application through micro-irrigation methods

Recently, India emerged as a torch bearer at the 26th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, as it presented very ambitious yet promising goals for the coming decade.

But is it possible to achieve these goals without considering the climate adaptability and sustainability of agriculture?

Sustainability and climate adaptability of our agriculture (our crops and soil) depend on what we put into our fields, what leaches from our fields and gets added to our water / air. Clearly, the needle is pointing at our nutrient management practices.

Since the Green Revolution, our dependence on chemical fertilisers as a source of plant nutrients has increased manifold and this made India a self-sufficient nation. Why still did we rank 101 out of 116 countries in the Global Hunger Index?

One of the major reasons is that somewhere, we lost sight of our traditional agricultural practices and use of chemical fertilisers became imbalanced or skewed.

Read more: CSE report flags poor state of organic fertilisers, biofertilisers sector in India

Imbalanced chemical fertilisation then started showing its ill effects in terms of soil health deterioration, vis-a-vis organic matter depletion, soil structure degradation, disturbance in soil hydro-thermal balance, heavy metal contamination and above all, an imbalanced human diet, to name a few.

Yes, we need to feed our ever-increasing mouths, but this must be done without further deteriorating our soils, climate or for that matter, human health. The path forward can start with balanced Integrated Nutrient Management and slowly pave a way towards adapting organic or biofertilisers as an alternative to chemical fertilisers.

One must note that this year, farmers are hassled because there is no urea or diammonium phosphate in the market. But the Green Revolution started with guano (seabird and bat droppings). Then why can’t it be done today, even if at small scale or in an integrated manner?

Moreover, looking at the changing perspectives of consumers and improving health consciousness among masses, farmers cannot avoid this adaptation for long.

Read more: High fertiliser prices shock farmers even as ministry denies shortage reports

Adaptation of organic or biofertilisers by our nearly 43 per cent of workforce has its own share of challenges and without doubt, it would be a slow process. This would require an extremely strong approach and, by extension, workforce.

Lab-to-land programmes of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and state agriculture universities must come out of the shackles of multi-coloured files and be implemented on the field, to convince farmers of the results.

A farmer will not and should not accept anything that does not give them fruitful results. Using practical demonstrations and statistical analysis, it must be demonstrated to the farmers that yield will not reduce, their benefit-cost ratio will improve and quality parameters of the market for the produce will be met.

It must be displayed how, through this adaptation, their future generations will thank them for the soil, water and air they will inherit. Now, if we succeed at convincing the farmers, we need to meet their demands of certified quality, assured nutrient content, organic and bio fertilizers which are competitive enough with chemical fertilizers in terms of nutrient content, solubility, plant availability and prices.

Organic and bio-fertilisers must penetrate the fertiliser market the way urea or single super phosphate did in the 60s. A proper retail, marketing and distribution network needs to be penned out.

Read more: CSE report flags poor state of organic fertilisers, biofertilisers sector in India

Organic and bio-fertilisers should also be made suitable for application through micro-irrigation methods. Also, once farmers use these adaptations, they must be ensured that their produce — perishable or non-perishable — will have storage, transportation and market facilities available, along with accurate certification services.

In the end, for their organic produce, farmers should get a price which is at least at par or more than the prices gained by the counterpart.

As and when we start overcoming these challenges, we might see adaptation of organics and biofertilisers at a large scale. Till then, farmers should get the best of both worlds.

796804,How Organic Farmers Can Reap Even Stronger Profits with the Specialty Markets,"Share this

24 August 2021, UK: Investors diversify their portfolios for financial stability. Farmers can do the same by diversifying their crops and the markets they serve.

If you’re an organic farmer, you’re already off to a great start. But you can diversify even more — and boost your bottom line — by getting into the organic specialty markets.

Capture higher premiums

Organic farmers already see significant profit potential from the high premiums of organic commodities. (Note: organic corn and soybeans have averaged over $9.50 and $20 per bushel, respectively, in the last decade.)

With specialty crops like popcorn, clear-hilum soybeans and grains for food companies, the premiums are even higher.

Also Read: Beyond the Vine: Breeding Better Grapes

You can conservatively expect to sell organic specialty crops for 10% above organic commodities.

Finding the right buyer

Breaking into the specialty markets depends on two things: your reputation and your network.

We recommend growers get some solid organic production experience before venturing into the specialty markets.

Even the best farmers make mistakes in their early years of organic. You don’t want a valuable learning experience to occur on an important contract.

On B&B Irlbeck Farms, we were certified organic for 5 years before we got into specialty crops. I’d advise giving it at least 3 years after transitioning to organic.

Once you’ve built up your organic experience and reputation, you can begin to seek out buyers.

Don’t be afraid to make some cold calls. Start in your own backyard. That’s how we became the organic grower for a local distillery.

How to serve the specialty markets

Scored a contract? Congrats! Now it’s time to make sure you deliver.

Naturally, specialty markets pay more because it takes a higher level of management and production.

You need to be even more on top of the weeds and fertility. And you need to make sure you’re buying the right organic seed.

But growing the crop isn’t usually the toughest part. The challenge is managing the business relationship and providing them the documents they need.

If your buyer calls up asking for information, you should be able to deliver it within 30 seconds.

You need to be organized and detail-oriented. And you need to manage risk well because a failure on your part could be detrimental to their business.

Finally, you need the proper infrastructure. Make sure you have the correct handling setup, drying setup and harvesting tools so you can manage the crop separately from your other organic and conventional crops.

What it takes to succeed

To be honest, not every organic farmer can serve the specialty markets. The time and management required to succeed may not fit with the rest of their operation.

So how do you know if you have what it takes to become a specialty grower? Talk to one. They can explain what it takes to succeed and how to determine if it’s a good move for your business.

If you don’t know any organic specialty growers, reach out to us. Our team at AgriSecure has first-hand experience with the specialty markets.

Our mission is to help farmers succeed with organics, so we’ll give you the expertise you need. Your first call with us is always free.",1
796821,Drone Based Potato Crop Management Technologies,"Share this

05 February 2022, New Delhi: In the wake of immense potential of the Application of unmanned Aerial Vehicle also known as “Drone”, the ICAR-Central Potato Research Institute, Shimla, Himachal Pradesh has initiated the work for the “Development of Drone-based Potato Crop Management Technologies” at its Regional Stations of Modipuram and Jalandhar since 2020. The initiative was undertaken in collaboration with the Bayer Crop Science Ltd. India and General Aeronautics Pvt. Ltd. having defined objective of developing the précised Crop Management Technologies for the Potato Crop.

Project activity was started in first year after getting necessary permissions from the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA), and local administration. The trials at two locations for two years on agro-chemicals (fungicides, insecticides and weedicides) spray using the Drone has clearly demonstrated advantage of increased precision and efficiency with lower water requirement, reduced environmental hazards and no phytotoxicity in Potato Crop.

To achieve the targeted productivity in the Potato Crop in a short span of 90 to 110 days, the frequent application of pesticides is required as the crop is susceptible for large numbers of insect-pests and diseases.

In the first step, the recommended doses of pesticides were evaluated with ultra-low volume of water in Drone Spray for phytotoxicity, uniformity of spray and possible drift. A multi-rotor UAV (General Aeronautics, India) with six propellers was used to spray pesticides and weedicides. The on-board UAV had a battery pack (27 Ah), RF (Radio Frequency)-based Transceiver, Microcontroller, GPS and Safety Sensors for communication and flight parameters. Its ultra-low volume spraying system consisted of a liquid chemical storage tank of 20 Litres capacity and four centrifugal atomizing nozzles had an overall swath of 4 meter. Ground Control Software was used for navigation and control of operational parameters.

The UAV Flight was configured to maintain a speed of 12.6 Km/Hr with a flow rate of 60 Ltr./Hr. at an altitude of 2 M above the ground level. With this speed and swath, the Drone sprayed approximately 1.26 ha area in about 15 Minutes. The Geotags of the field were configured in the UAV using the GPS to navigate the system on a predefined path.

In the first Year, the Drone Application of eight pesticides was done in an area of 1.2 ha and observations on penetration efficiency, pesticide drift, plant coverage and phytotoxicity were recorded using the standard protocols. The uniform and better penetration with fine droplet coverage at all three levels (top, middle & bottom) of potato plants was observed in Drone Spray; whereas, lesser penetration at lower level of plants and bigger droplet size were observed in tractor mounted and battery operated knapsack sprayers. None of the pesticides exhibited any phytotoxicity in Potato Crop. The Spray drift was observed in 5 m buffer zone, but the quantity was negligible. Similarly, 14 pesticides were evaluated separately and or as tank mix in the second crop season and results were encouraging as better chemical penetration and no phytotoxicity was observed. The Drift by Drone was also in safer limits.

The Drone-based Spraying had several advantages, that is, exact estimation of land area saved chemicals, very less water requirement per unit area as only 20 Ltr per ha was sufficient as compared to 500 to 750 Ltr water needed in conventional spraying and spray efficiency as time taken to cover one ha was less than 15 Minutes. The initial findings of current studies indicated that drone-based application of pesticides is safe and can be used on large scale for effective management of potato pests and diseases. The results can easily be converted into recommendations for the Potato Crop following the SOPs developed by the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India as released on 21st December, 2021.

The Institute also initiated the Awareness Programmes on Drone Technology. The use of the Drone Technology in Indian Agriculture particularly, in the Potato Crop is really a great leap towards smart farming of the future.",1
796861,Gene Modified Mustard Gets Environmental Approval,"The ""environmental release"" of the transgenic hybrid mustard DMH-11 for seed production and the execution of field demonstration studies concerning its effects, if any, on honeybees and other pollinating insects was approved by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) that comes under the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change.

The GEAC is the agency in charge of evaluating requests for the ""release"" of GM organisms and products (often regarded as harmful) into the environment. In this instance, it has advised against DMH-11 being released into the environment before the commercial distribution for its seed production and testing. In other words, it has approved farmer commercial cultivation, with seed production serving as the initial phase.

The environmental release of the parental lines from DMH-11 (containing the genes for barnase and barstar gene system) so that they can be utilized to create new hybrids has also been advised by GEAC. Such hybrids might produce yields that are even higher than DHM-11.

Indian mustard cultivars have a limited genetic background. The barnase-barstar gene system makes it possible to breed hybrids from a larger variety of mustard species, including those with East European ancestry, such ""Heera"" and ""Donskaja.""

Several green organizations have opposed GM crops in general. There have also been two specific worries raised regarding GM mustard.

The first is the existence of a third ""bar"" gene, which makes GM mustard plants resistant to the application of the weed-killing chemical glufosinate-ammonium. The argument made by the opponents is that encouraging the use of chemical herbicides will result in the displacement of physical labour used for weeding.

However, the DMH-11 creators assert that the bar is merely a marker gene. It is used to identify the genetically modified plants required for mass seed production because non-GM plants cannot tolerate herbicide application.

The threat or devastation of GM mustard on honeybee populations is the second issue of concern. Honeybees and a variety of other pollinating insects can find nectar in mustard flowering plants.

However, the GEAC has cited the report that this GM mustard crop doesn’t possess any adverse effects on honeybees and other insect pollinators.",1
1102,Equipping farmers with agritech,"New Delhi: In September last year, some villages in Amravati district in Maharashtra�s Vidarbha saw yellow mosaic virus infestation in soybean crop. A team of experts went around villages to study the disease, while farmers in other villages were also asked to send in photos of their crop. Possible solutions to the problem were put up on Facebook, where thousands of farmers from across Maharashtra could access the information. The exercise helped farmers prevent crop loss by 40%, according to Desta Global estimates.

According to World Bank data, 60.6% of India�s total land was agricultural in 2011-2015 (bit.ly/1VgLv9v), and agriculture added 17.8% to the country�s gross domestic product in 2014 (bit.ly/1U52Rot). Still, farming in India is more dependant on good fortune than knowledge. From identifying the right crops for the right soil to preventing them from pest attacks, it�s a matter of chance since most farmers are not aware of technological advances that can help improve their lives livelihood.

Desta Global, whose experts fanned out to the Amaravati villages, was started to change that. �We treat farmers as entrepreneurs,"" says chief executive officer (CEO) Mohnish Sharma. The company was founded in 2010 by Nishant Banore of Mumbai, who was a student at ISB, Hyderabad, with the help of Ronald Boehm, an American investor, as a platform to provide rural farmers information, innovation and technology.

Previous chapter

�My wife and I have a social investment business, BOMA Investments, which invests in for-profit businesses that have a positive social or environmental purpose,"" said Boehm in an email. �We had been thinking of working in the agricultural sector for about seven years. The idea was to focus on the inputs side of agriculture�soil preparations, seeds, fertilizers, and labour saving equipment.""

�When I met Nishant in Hyderabad five years ago, it became possible to start such a business,�� Boehm said. Banore has since moved on to the US to pursue other interests while Boehm is still actively involved with the company.

The idea was to improve the income of farmers by 10%. The problem was identifying a way to monetise the business to make it sustainable.

The solution was three-pronged: an e-commerce website to buy and sell agricultural products such as seeds, fertilizers, farm tools, etc. (DestaMart); an online portal to provide farmers relevant information (DestaTalk); and a portal to host a curated list of farming-related innovation (DestaLabs).

�By 2014, they realized that the company can�t be (like) an NGO,"" said Sharma who came on board as CEO in 2014, referring to non-government organisations that are mostly mandated not to charge for their services. �Before this, I was running a small financial journalism company in Mumbai. Ron�s experience was that the initiative should be doing social good but for profit,"" he says.

So, they started organizing fairs in villages that connected government officials and agricultural experts with local farmers.

For DestaTalk, the Eureka moment came in January 2015. A team was visiting Sangli. �We distributed pamphlets among villagers promising them free information online or through cellphones. Within three days, more than 1,200 farmers signed up for the service,"" said Sharma. �And then, I was told that we could only get 1,200 names because the people who were writing the names couldn�t write fast enough.""

Challenges

The biggest challenge for Desta Global has always been the shortage of manpower due to financial constraints. Boehm, the only investor so far, has put in $2 million. �It is content marketing for us and there is only so much time that we can devote to it. There are limited resources that we have at our disposal for Desta Talk. But we are fairly frugal in investing,"" said Sharma. He said the company, having started with investments from Boehm, is now actively looking for series-A funding.

The digital advantage

Access to information and communication technology plays a crucial role in development. Mobile network penetration has helped the business immensely. �It has helped us connect with farmers on a more regular basis. Right now, we are in touch with some 20,000 farmers by SMS and over WhatsApp groups,"" says Sharma.

Future plans

All of Desta Talk�s content is in Marathi. Sharma says the company is focused on Maharashtra right now. Sharma wants to impact 10 million farmers across India by December. �What we�d like to do with Desta Talk is to go around the country in the next three years and provide content in local languages,"" said Sharma.",1

In addition, the innovations must have a sufficient and obvious return on investment (ROI) for the producer. The time frame of that ROI often gets missed, says Kevin Lockett, a partner and chief financial officer at Fulcrum Global Capital.

�When we talk about agriculture, many times the ROI is the actual growing season, because each growing season is different,� Lockett says. �Farmers are looking for a very short period where they will at least break even by trying a technology. If it is truly value added, then over time there will be an increase in benefit and, hopefully, in margin.� 

Located in Kansas, the firm also includes Duane Cantrell, managing partner and chief executive officer, and John Peryam, a partner and general counsel. The trio has more than 100 years of experience building, growing, and investing in industry-leading companies.",1
1105,THE ADVANCEMENT OF PRECISION TILLAGE TECHNOLOGY,"Tillage has come a long way since John Deere invented the self-scouring steel plow in 1837. Once a basic tool for turning the soil, the implement is being developed into a machine that gives producers the ability to vary tillage settings based on changing soil types, field conditions, conservation practices, and topography.

�Thanks to technology advancements, farmers don�t just set up the tillage tool then worry about raising and lowering implements on field ends today. With precision tillage technology, some implements also connect into the tractor-implement CAN bus enabling implement adjustments on the go,� says John Fulton, a professor in the Department of Food, Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Ohio State University.

In the past three years, he believes, precision tillage technology has come to the forefront. �The more tactical pieces to precision tillage are mitigating soil compaction and managing surface residue,� Fulton says.

Like the variable-rate approach used for seed, fertilizer, and chemicals, prescription tillage technology offers farmers or their trusted advisers the ability to create prescriptions to vary the depth and intensity of tillage tools on the go.

�The prescription can automatically adjust the implement�s settings such as the depth of shanks and disks, the gang angle of disks as well as down pressure of wings and rolling baskets as it moves across the field,� Fulton says.

DIALING IN ON DEPTH
Because Eran McCormick deals with a range of soils, maintaining the right depth with a field cultivator has been an ongoing challenge.

�On our clay knobs, the field cultivator seemed like it was just scratching the surface or only going about a half to an inch deep,� says McCormick, who grows corn and soybeans about 20 minutes northeast of Lafayette, Indiana. �In our lower ground, where the dirt is soft and black, the field cultivator would bury 6 inches deep.�

To solve the issue, he decided it was time to experiment with TruSet. Offered on his John Deere 2230FH field cultivator, TruSet allows McCormick to run variable-depth tillage prescriptions to incorporate residue at different levels across the field, as well as change the depth of tillage for different conditions such as lighter soils or areas where compaction is an issue. At the same time, he could document tillage passes to see how strategies affected crop emergence or yield.

Steve Sporrer says a prescription can be simple or complex, depending on what the field needs. �It can be based off soil maps, topography, compaction, and yield data to create different tillage zones,� says the tillage product manager with John Deere.

Using soil maps, McCormick�s fields have two to eight zones. Practicing conventional tillage, the TruSet depth is set at 2 to 21?2 inches in black ground and 3 to 31?2 on clay soil. Including the tire sink he achieves his desired 4-inch working depth.

�Now we can hold that 2-inch planting depth a lot better on corn. We also run the field cultivator in front of the soybean planter, but it seems to be a bigger issue in corn, because we�re going another 3?4 inch deeper,� he says. �Once we figured out what our settings should be, consistency of depth has been fabulous compared to the old way.�

1108,AGRICULTURE EMBRACES ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,"Graybeards may remember the thrill they felt when pencil-laden math calculations moved warp speed ahead into the calculator age.

These days, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to bring the same heat to agriculture that it did to math classes decades ago. Artificial intelligence is a technology that includes several subsets such as machine learning, says Rania Khalaf, Inari chief information and data officer.

�Machine learning enables computers to mathematically predict outcomes or make classifications by finding patterns in large amounts of data,� she says. �It then learns to update these patterns or classifications over time as it sees new data.�

�The biggest advantage of artificial intelligence is the ability to make complex calculations at a high speed that previously required a human to perform,� adds Kent Klemme, general manager of See & Spray for Blue River Technology. �The recent improvements in GPUs [graphics processing units] have provided the computing power to make this possible. It takes a lot of data to target specific problems.�

See & Spray Ultimate technology � powered by machine learning � enables sprayers to target just weeds while spraying among crops. �We�ve taken thousands and thousands of images of different weeds in different crops under different situations such as clear skies, cloudy skies, dark skies, different soils, and varying levels of residue,� says Klemme.

Blue River and John Deere data scientists then train the See & Spray Ultimate system to recognize plants under myriad conditions. These images are sorted out through algorithms, which involve repetition of one or more mathematical operation. Algorithms are often implemented and solved on computers.

Patriot 50 series sprayers from Case IH use a form of machine learning called vision guidance.",1

This level of transparency is then transferred down the line to consumers, supporting demand for sustainable consumption,"" Deshpande says.",1
1117,TECHNOLOGY ADDS EFFICIENCIES IN COUNTING PLANTS AND ASSESSING EARLY-STAGE CROPS,"Calculated soon after plants emerge, stand counts and seedling assessments help producers gain a rough estimate of potential crop losses. New technology from Corteva Agriscience offers an improvement on the traditional process of gathering this information, crucial in determining next steps.

READ MORE: How to get the most out of data
The manual process generally is conducted by measuring 1 ?1,000 acre based on row width, counting the number of live plants in the measured area, repeating this process multiple times in random locations across a field, and then extrapolating the total losses. It is not only time-consuming but also often inaccurate.

�In an 80-acre field, I will check three to 10 different spots, which can take a significant amount of time,� says Paul Yoder, a Pioneer field agronomist. �Because only a small percentage of a field is scouted, it�s not unusual to miss an area that may be struggling.�

Plants that emerge later than others create havoc for the plants beside them. Normally, growing plants will eventually overshadow late-emerging ones, depriving them of the sunlight necessary to grow properly. While late-emerging plants may not grow as much as the others, they take precious nutrients from the soil.

LISTEN: Collecting ag technology data
Producers who find a poor stand must decide if they should intervene and replant or simply live with the losses. �If a producer did replant, it wasn�t uncommon for him to basically replant the whole field,� Yoder says. �It�s a different view from the tractor cab not knowing where you should drop the planter to fill in those thin areas. There was a lot of frustration in not knowing if you were being efficient or cost-effective as you went back and forth in that field.�

Equipped with Corteva�s Stand Assessment technology, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides an alternative to the traditional method of scouting fields. Created within Corteva�s digital research and development program, the technology was licensed to DroneDeploy in early 2020. �One of the early lessons I learned in agriculture was that the best fertilizer is a farmer�s footsteps,� says Mike Winn, CEO of DroneDeploy. �We aren�t here to replace him, but we are here to help him put those footsteps in the right locations.�

OFF-LINE TOOL
Performed at the edge of a field, Stand Assessment is an off-line tool that provides a faster, automated, and streamlined workflow designed to determine crop emergence for early-stage fields. The best time to assess corn, Yoder says, is from the V2 and V4 growth stage. It�s about the same stage in soybeans but is more of a gap analysis.

READ MORE: Machinery and parts sales go online
�The technology is going to tell me the amount of bare soil in between plants. If you set your gap analysis at 3 feet within the rows, Purdue University research shows about a 13% yield reduction. At the end of the day, it may not be a perfect stand, but the producer can anticipate that loss based on the field�s average yield,� he says, adding that evaluating stand count on an 80-acre field takes about 10 minutes.

The tool also gives farmers the ability to make replant decisions while they finish planting other fields. �By knowing 16 acres in an 80- acre field has to be replanted, it gives us time to gather the seed because the farmer may not have what he needs,� Yoder says. �If I�m able to help him gain those 16 acres back, the return on investment adds up pretty quickly.�

Of the 10 Illinois Pioneer Seeds representatives Yoder works with, nine have invested in their own drones and six of the nine have invested in the DroneDeploy software. �I feel technology like this draws us closer to the grower because he knows either his seed representative or I can come fly his fields to give him that reassurance,� he says. �The uses for this technology continue to advance. One of my representatives is looking at buying a larger drone to spray fungicide.�

�It�s really about getting additional information and those insights we can understand and act on to continually improve,� says Casey Onstot, U.S. digital leader for Corteva. �There are so many data points we�re trying to capture. It would take days if we scouted every square inch of a field to understand every plant. Utilizing a drone, we can scout an entire field, capture data, gain insights, and then send that information to the producer in a fraction of the time it took to do it manually.�",1
1118,Applying modern tech to agriculture,"Modern agriculture is driven by continuous improvements in digital tools and data as well as collaborations among farmers and researchers across the public and private sectors.

During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, India could achieve self-sufficiency in food grain production by using modern methods of agriculture like better quality of seeds, proper irrigation, chemical fertilisers and pesticides.

As time passed, more technological advances appeared in agriculture. The tractor was introduced, followed by new tillage and harvesting equipment, irrigation and air seeding technology, all leading to higher yields and improved quality of the food and fibre that was grown.

It is possible for farmers to utilise scientific data and technology to improve crop yields and keep themselves up-to-date with cutting edge methods of farming.

Here are some examples of how modern technology can be used to improve agriculture:

1. Monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems via smartphone

Mobile technology is playing an important role in monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems.

With this modern technology, a farmer can control his irrigation systems from a phone or computer instead of driving to each field.

Moisture sensors in the ground are able to communicate information about the level of moisture present at certain depths in the soil.

2. Ultrasounds for livestock

Ultrasound is not only for checking on baby animals in the womb. It also can be used to discover what quality of meat might be found in an animal before it goes to the market.

The testing of DNA helps producers to identify animals with good pedigrees and other desirable qualities. This information can also be used to help the farmer to improve the quality of his herds.

3. Usage of mobile technology and cameras

Some farmers and ranchers use apps like �Foursquare� to keep tabs on employees. They also put up cameras around the farm.

Livestock managers are wiring up their barn feedlots and pastures with cameras that send images back to the central location like an office or home computer. They can keep a closer eye on the animals when they are away or home for the night.

4. Crop Sensors

Crop sensors help apply fertilisers in a very effective manner, maximising uptake. They sense how your crop is feeling and reduce the potential leaching and runoff into ground water.

Instead of making a prescription fertiliser map for a field before you go out to apply it, crop sensors tell application equipment how much to apply in real time.

Optical sensors are able to see how much fertiliser a plant may need, based on the amount of light reflected back to the sensor.

Vision about modern agriculture

Nearly everyone working on the future of modern agriculture is focused on efficiency. A wide range of technologies will enable the transition of modern agriculture in the field.

Some technologies will need to be developed specifically for agriculture, while other technologies already developed for other areas could be adapted to the modern agricultural domain such as autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and machine vision.

If modern agriculture is applied widely in the near future, millions of farmers will be able to benefit from the acquisition of real-time farm information.

Farmers need not spend significant amount of time on acquiring farm data and will have access to disaster warnings and weather information when a disaster event occurs.

It is difficult to predict the future of technology in agriculture but there are many promising trends and pilot projects.",1
1119,How big data can boost agricultural growth,"In agriculture, big data is often viewed as a combination of technology and analytics that can collect and compile novel data and process it in a more useful and timely way to assist decision making.

Data mining is the computing process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning statistics and database system.

Precision agriculture�s main objective is to ensure profitability, efficiency, and sustainability using the big data gathered to guide both immediate and future decision-making. This could cover everything � from when it is best to apply fertilizers, chemical and seeds, to from where in the field it is best to apply a rate.

According to agriculture funders, the big data practice comprises capturing relevant data from a huge number of sources, collecting it today and translating it into actionable information to improve business processes and solve problems at scale and speed.

Real-time insights to help performance optimisation advance analytics can show how farmers are utilising their inputs and what adaptations are required to take account of emerging weather events or disease outbreaks.

To achieve this, advanced algorithms are needed to swiftly unlock the highly valuable insights for products to perform well on an ongoing basis despite changing conditions. The development of highly-specific customer segmentation set has become possible to tailor product offerings to meet customer needs.

For instance, if Black Grass becomes problematic in a given region, suppliers can deploy big data techniques such as real-time micro-segmentation of customers to target promotional and marketing activities, thus facilitating better utilisation of marketing spends. Big data connectivity has proven itself a key asset for companies seeking a competitive advantage over their competitors.

Benefits include faster unearthing of valuable insights and the ability to develop and adapt products that meet specific customer needs on an ongoing basis.

Robots can play an important role in control, but it can be expected that the role of humans in analysis and planning is increasingly assisted by machines so that the cyber physical cycle becomes almost autonomous.

Considering its potential, various agri-tech companies are providing their services to the producers to make the practice more approachable and available. Hardware-wise there are various sensors collecting the available data.

In this range, we can encounter autonomous vehicle devices farmers place in the ground to measure soil moisture and nutrient, predictive weather stations and image-capturing satellites and drones mapping out land and measuring crop health.

These insights are extremely important since they tell the farmer when and how much to irrigate a field, crop health, weather predictions, pest infestations and even drought conditions. Considering the increasing labor shortages in the sector the capacity for big data analysis that lessens the need for physical manpower is of great advantage for agriculture.

Role of data analysis in agriculture

Application of science and new technologies is currently lacking within this space. Many companies and start-ups are looking to fill this information gap. If Big Data has made serious advancement in fields like information technology, healthcare, education and even sports, there is an obvious need for it in the agricultural industry too.

While the vast majority of farmers and ranchers did great work for maintaining and increasing soil health using conservation practices alone, measurement tools will be instrumental in ensuring a sustainable farming future.

To maintain yields and meet the food demands of a growing population while also protecting natural resources required, making additional changes and data tools can help determine what these changes should be.

The end result of gathering data is to analyse it and come up with actionable solutions with better results. For example, a satellite image of a plot of land has several layers of data embedded into a single spectrum giving us a tonne of information to analyse. The geospatial approach and satellite monitoring of farms have led to major advancement in how farmers and companies make their decisions.

Advantages of data analysis in agriculture

Data helps debt-laden farmers, insurance agencies, loan banks, seed companies, machine industry and every big and small player. Data analysis not only creates greater awareness and more accurate knowledge, but it can also plug the lacunae in the supply and marketing chain of the industry.

Information is power, and the industry can now have access to it for more informed decision making. These are the ways in which data analysis can help:

Development of new seed traits - Access to the plant genome with new ways to measure, map and drive information betters products.

Precision farming - Big data takes advantage of information derived through precision farming in aggregate over many farms. The resulting analytics, insights and better decisions can then be deployed through precision farming techniques

Food tracking - Use of sensors and analytics to prevent spoilage and food-borne illnesses

Effect on supply chains - Seismic shifts in the supply chain of seed, crop inputs and food driven by the democratisation of technology and information",1
1125,New targets to protect biodiversity must include farmers and agriculture,"The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity is a treaty that aims to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of a country�s natural resources, or biological diversity. This is a general strategy that all countries must then adopt at the local level.

The Convention � a legally-binding international treaty � is currently negotiating new targets for the next 30 years. Decisions are made by parties to the convention, made up of 196 countries, supported by a range of observers including NGOs, researchers and academics.

Read more: We're coming up with a new set of targets to protect the natural world. Here's how

But the Convention is about to make a mistake: it concentrates primarily on protected areas when it should also recognise the potential of managing agricultural landscapes for biodiversity.

In its �modified zero draft�, released in October, of 20 targets only one refers to �agricultural and other managed ecosystems�. But its focus is essentially on biodiversity for food. It misses the point that agro-ecosystems can contribute to conservation through providing habitat to wild species and harbouring fragments of natural habitat, such as forests and wetlands.

Africa�s protected areas cover an area of 20.4 million km� or 15.1% of the landmass. But experts say this isn�t enough. For instance, 7% of Kenya�s land is formally protected but between 20-30% of contiguous habitat is needed to maintain populations of �umbrella� species. Protecting these species indirectly protects many other species within its habitat.

Given population pressure, it is not politically feasible to increase the extent of protected areas. The question is how will Africa provide space for its wildlife and food production?

Agriculture dominates sub-Saharan African economies. It contributes on average 15% of total GDP, covers vast tracts of land and is often the main source of livelihoods in rural areas.

We argue that the new framework must recognise the importance of agriculture for conservation. And that the best way to protect Africa�s biodiversity is to integrate conservation measures on working lands. This will also create jobs and income opportunities for farming communities.

An international treaty that draws attention away from this huge stock of land � where biodiversity conservation could be actively supported with investments into mixed farming regimes � runs the risk of skewing policies. It will also miss the opportunity to bring ministries of agriculture and environment together to tackle one of the biggest challenge of the decade.

Land sharing that works

The Convention on Biological Diversity has traditionally seen agriculture as one of the biggest threats to biodiversity. It has promoted the protection of natural ecosystems by concentrating on preventing further expansion of agriculture. But evidence shows that farms that share landscapes with wild nature, such as remnant forests and trees, benefit from the ecosystem services provided.

Farming systems that integrate conservation combine a diversity of crops, animals and trees � with different spatial and seasonal arrangements � and mimic natural water and nutrient processes.

This creates less need for artificial inputs like fertilisers, herbicides and pesticides. These farming systems are in line with the traditional farming practices of small holders in sub-Saharan Africa and integrate well with traditional knowledge and practices.There are examples of the successful relationship between farmers, agriculture and conservation all over the continent.

For instance in Ethiopia, cereal farmers use nearby forests to feed livestock. The livestock roam the forest during the day and return to farms at night, providing farmers with organic fertiliser.

This is important for smallholder farmers because the availability and accessibility of agricultural inputs � such as fertilisers � remain low. Farms close to forests have better soil fertility and produced more nutritious food than those part of an intensified cereal landscape. And forests benefit because they�re not being cleared for agriculture.

Another example is the 400 km2 Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya�s Laikipia County. Ol Pejeta is home to 130 black rhinos and 7,500 cattle. It has increased the black rhino population by 100% in 10 years. In 2019, it employed 700 people and generated US$1.4 million from livestock production and US$4.8 million from tourism.

The business model is multi-dimensional. By optimising tourism and livestock production, the conservancy can generate higher economic returns per hectare than by specialising on one dimension. Their success demonstrates that one key to wildlife conservation in Kenya is not to protect more areas, but turn conservation into a profitable business.

Grey areas

The debate about whether agriculture should be kept separate from conservation shouldn�t presented be as a black or white choice. There are many shades of grey in land-use planning.

�Land sparing� � where agriculture is kept separate � is supposed to address trade-offs between productivity and conservation by maximising productivity in one place while leaving other places in �natural� condition. One critique of this is that in most cases crop productivity is the sole criterion of performance, not managing the trade-offs between economic, social and environmental objectives.

Other studies, show that incorporating other criteria � for example livestock productivity, sustainability, resilience, equitability, ecosystem service provision � may portray a different situation: one less dominated by short term trade-offs, but rather by synergies where one land use might support other objectives. This would contribute to more food security in the long run.

What are the implications?

International biodiversity policy will have impact on land use over the next 30 years. Countries will plan investments around policies they have signed. Donors will align with international commitments. Developing countries will find that funding is channelled through instruments aligned with global policies.

International funding instruments need to be available so that African governments can ensure their farming communities live and prosper in harmony with nature. African farmers deserve a convention that recognises the importance of protected natural landscapes but also of managing wild biodiversity sustainably in farming landscapes.

1144,Technological Advancements in Agriculture are Providing New Career Opportunities in Agri Sector,"In terms of agriculture, India has made enormous progress throughout the years. The country has become self-sufficient in food. Despite the fact that agriculture has become one of the most profitable industries in the world, there is still a global food crisis.The global population is predicted to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, owing to the rapid population growth. The food business is now faced with the difficult task of making ends meet. Agriculture employs more than 27% of the worldwide workforce, with India's agriculture sector employing over 152 million people as of FY 2021.

Here, innovative agricultural technologies (AgriTech) are allowing the agriculture sector to thrive in India and around the world, while also helping to meet the demands of an ever-increasing population. Agriculture Technology (AgriTech) is a branch of new innovative agriculture technology developed to raise the efficiency and yield of agricultural processes in simple terms.

AgriTech encompasses a variety of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), all of which aim to grow more food with fewer inputs, lower costs, and save time. The global AgriTech market is predicted to increase at a CAGR of 12.1 percent to more than $41,000 million by 2027, up from over $17,500 million in 2019. The country's AgriTech business had been humming.

Significantly growing. The AgriTech market potential in India was more than $2.4 billion in FY2020, adding a GVA of 56 percent, and is predicted to reach a value of $24 billion by 2025. Another analysis estimates that by 2025, the market would be worth $35 billion. Over the years, the Agri Tech field has piqued the curiosity of many entrepreneurs, engineers, and venture capitalists.

Some of the AgriTech occupations that will be in high demand in the future are listed below.

1147,Dutch Innovation Uses 90% Less Water to Help Grow Plants in the World's Driest Regions,"The Waterboxx plant cocoon technology has kept a plant in full bloom during the high temperature of Santa Helena. Dutch businessman Pieter Hoff developed this method in 2003.A plant is in full bloom on Ecuador's scorching peninsula of Santa Helena, where daily radiation levels reach 8,000 joules. The Gmelina Arborea that grows here thrives despite the saline breezes, scorching temperatures of 41 degrees Celsius, and average precipitation of 111mm.

The Waterboxx plant cocoon technology, invented by Dutch businessman Pieter Hoff, has made this possible. He withdrew from his lily and tulip export business in 2003 and developed this method to enable various plants to grow in arid environments. Groasis is now involved in projects including reforestation and ecological restoration.

Green Oasis in the Desert
The harsh Santa Helena region isn't the only place where Groasis' technology is allowing vegetation to flourish. Greenery is flourishing in Canada, Dubai, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, and many other countries due to technological advances.

Groasis Technologies is involved in several projects, two of which are targeted at assisting plants in arid environments. The Waterboxx plant cocoon and the Growboxx plant cocoon are the two types. Both approaches give plants the essential water and nutrients until they can sustain themselves.Issues with the Standard Drip Irrigation System
There are two issues with the standard drip irrigation system used in agriculture. One is the large amount of water consumed per tree every day, ranging from 15 to 50 liters. The other issue is heat-induced evaporation. Drip irrigation is not only difficult in dry arid places where temperatures reach extremes and water is scarce, but it also imposes a strain on resources.

Waterboxx Plant Cocoons
Waterboxx plant cocoons can replace drip irrigation while using 90% less water. This invention works on a straightforward principle. Rainwater enters the Waterboxx and is collected in the chamber. Through a wick that enters into the ground, the collected water drips into the plant's root system. These roots penetrate deeper into the ground and thus become self-sufficient as the plant expands.

According to Groasis, the handy gadget is composed of polypropylene, making it reusable up to ten times. The setup can be removed and reused for another seed after nine to twelve months.

The method has a dual advantage, according to Groasis' research, in that it is an organic manner of producing plants because it does not utilize pesticides. Furthermore, the seedlings sown by this method have a high rate of survival.",1

Farmers' databases from the Anaj Kharid Portal will be used, and officials will conduct on-the-ground verification of farmers who choose DSR.The Punjab Cabinet, led by chief minister Bhagwant Mann, approved a Rs 1500 per acre incentive to farmers for sowing paddy using this innovative technology on Wednesday to promote Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR) technology for conserving underground water.

According to an official spokesperson, Rs 450 crore has been set aside to provide incentives to farmers for the promotion of less water-consuming and cost-effective technology. It is estimated that the exercise will save approximately 15-20% of water compared to the traditional puddling (kaddu) method during the crop life cycle.

According to estimates, farmers used DSR on over 15 lakh acres last year, and with the current availability of implements, this number can be increased to 30 lakh acres. The water table is currently falling at a rate of 86 cm per year, putting the state in jeopardy of having no underground water available for the next 15-20 years.

Concerns have been raised about the rapidly depleting groundwater, owing primarily to the water-intensive traditional method of paddy transplantation.The decision, according to the spokesperson, will encourage the majority of farmers to adopt this proven technique, which requires far less water for irrigation, improves percolation, reduces reliance on farm labour, and improves soil health, thereby increasing paddy and wheat yields by 5-10 percent.

It was decided to pay farmers financial assistance worth Rs 1500 per acre via Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT), for which the Punjab Mandi Board's Anaj Kharid Portal has a database of approximately 11 lakh farmers linked with their Aadhaar details, mobile number, and bank account details.

Farmers who choose DSR must register their interest on a portal developed in-house by a team of Mandi Board software developers. Farmers' databases from the Anaj Kharid Portal will be used, and officials will conduct on-the-ground verification of farmers who choose DSR.

Currently, approximately 4000 officers from various departments such as Agriculture, Horticulture, Mandi Board, and Water & Soil Conservation will be assigned to duty for verification. The incentive amount will be credited to farmers' accounts via DBT after verification.",1
1149,Implementation of Genome Editing Technology In Agriculture Can Improve Crop Varieties,"Crop genome editing could help breeding programs advance much more quickly. It has the potential to stimulate the development of characteristics in novel crops, allowing for increased yield and pest resistance, climate change adaption, and industrial and pharmaceutical applications.R.M. Sundaram, Director of the ICAR-Indian Institute of Rice Research, believes that genome editing for crop enhancement can speed up the delivery of superior cultivars.

He also stated while speaking at a workshop on the subject Genome Editing for Crop Improvement: Potential and Policy, organized cooperatively by Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) and Biotech Consortium India Limited (BCIL) on Friday, that genome editing technology is relatively inexpensive to implement and has widespread accessibility in both private and public sector research institutions.

The innovation could be implemented in almost any crop species for which a partial or full genome sequence is available, and it is being used to improve yields, nutritional quality, feed quality, and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in the face of depleting natural resources and a rapidly changing climate in more than 40 crops across 25 countries.Technology has the potential to help India reduce its reliance on imports by increasing the yield and productivity of pulses and oilseed crops. In 2020-21, India imported edible oils worth Rs.1.17 lakh crore and more than Rs.1 lakh crore in the first nine months of 2021-22.

Hanumanth K. Zendge, Special Commissioner (Agriculture), said it was necessary to address farmers' concerns before deploying new technologies in the field. It was critical to implement new technologies in order to ensure nutritional and food security for the rising population by educating farmers and assuaging their fears.

Modern farming technologies must be made widely available, according to PJTSAU Vice-Chancellor V. Praveen Rao, in order to increase farmers' income. He recommended that BCIL make an attempt to include genetic technology education in middle school curricula.

Vibha Ahuja, BCIL's Chief General Manager, discussed how genome editing technology is being used in agriculture and other sectors around the world, and how China and the United States have become leaders in this field.",1
1150,"Project Arth & ENACTUS IIT Delhi Students Receives ""Go Kasht"" Machine To Address Waste Management in Gaushala","The use of a cow dung-based log machine can assist Gaushala in addressing their waste management issues, providing an additional source of employment to its employees or nearby villagers, and contributing to the reduction of deforestation.Today, Parshottam Rupala, Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairy, handed over a cow dung log machine, known as the ""Go Kasht,"" to Project Arth and ENACTUS IIT Delhi students. Cow dung log machine is used to produce long log-like pieces of cow dung-based fuel wood.

This machine's inlet (hopper) is filled with a mixture of cow dung and cattle waste (similar to dried waste paddy). The machine then breaks it down, mixes it, and compresses the mixture into the shape of a log. This log is then sun-dried and can be used as fuelwood in a variety of situations.

This machine can process 3000 kg of cow dung per day, resulting in 1500 kg of cow dung-based logs that can be used as firewood for the cremation of 5-7 bodies, saving approximately 2 trees per cremation. That means it can assist the gaushala in clearing approximately 150,000 to 170,000 kg of cow dung each month.

The use of a cow dung-based log machine can assist Gaushala in addressing their waste management issues, providing an additional source of employment to its employees or nearby villagers, and contributing to the reduction of deforestation.It also assists in involving non-milking cows in a profitable activity, generating funds to support all of the cows in a gaushala.

A mixture of dung and straw (or any other agro waste/harvested crop residues) is fed into the machine's hopper. The machine has a screw mechanism that aids in thoroughly mixing raw materials, compressing them, and extruding them.

We can make logs of various sizes and shapes by using different die sizes. The logs are then exposed to sunlight to dry out the moisture inside them, making them hard and sturdy like wood. This machine can prepare one kilogram of wood in 15 seconds and will cost between Rs 600 and 700 per quintal. A large number of trees are cut down to provide wood for funerals, which harms the environment and adds to pollution.

Cow dung wood is extremely beneficial because it is environmentally friendly. This wood will be used for Havan, Yagya-Pooja texts, rituals, and other purposes. Youth will also have access to job opportunities. In addition, you can make a good living by creating other products from cow dung, such as sculptures, face packs, and medicines.",1
1154,How Blockchain Technology Can Revolutionize Agriculture Sector?,"Blockchain is a technology that can bring breakthroughs in the Agri sector with its potential.Blockchain agriculture improves food safety by allowing information to be traced across the food supply chain. The capacity of blockchain to store and manage data enables traceability, which is utilized to assist in the development and implementation of technologies for intelligent farming and index-based agriculture insurance.

It represents a significant advancement in the field of modern agriculture. But how exactly does it work, and how does it make food safer?

What is Blockchain Technology?
With the growing popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you've probably heard a lot about blockchain technology, but it may surprise you to hear that it's being used in agriculture.

ICT (information and communication technology) is now being employed for databases to track data and maintain information flow. Blockchain technology is a novel method of powering these databases. Instead of a single server and administrator, they give rights to all network members. Multiple parties may then access and validate new additions to the database, providing more security and reducing the possibility of corruption.

Uses of Blockchain Technologies in Agriculture
Blockchain technologies can track all types of information about plants, such as seed quality, and crop growth, and even generate a record of the journey of the plant after it leaves the farm. This data can improve supply chain transparency and eliminate concerns associated with illegal and unethical operations. In the case of a recall, they can also make it easier to track any contamination or other issues back to their source. The primary goals of these technologies are sustainability and food security.When consumers have this amount of transparency, they can make informed purchasing decisions. They frequently utilize this information to reward farmers and producers that implement good farming methods.

Barriers to Using Blockchain Technologies
There are concerns that blockchain technology may be misapplied or exploited, endangering food security. Privately owned blockchains, for example, are simpler to tamper with and less secure. Because these blockchains rely on regulations imposed by private organizations, it is simple to understand how the wrong individuals may use them to their benefit. Meanwhile, small-scale farmers who lack sufficient size, technological know-how, and scalability to use blockchain technology may be left behind.

Many issues must be resolved before blockchain technology can be completely incorporated into agriculture.

First, blockchain implementation must be decentralized to accommodate small farmers and rural dwellers. Otherwise, food security will remain a problem. Implementation must enable sustainable and equitable food systems, allowing consumers to make a better decisions.

Those who do not have the necessary digital literacy to participate in blockchain technology must be educated. This is part of the process of decentralizing the system. The worlds poor may be unable to engage due to the aging infrastructure and a lack of digital literacy.",1
1158,"Radiation technology is being introduced in the agricultural sector by the mutual agreement of BARC and SKUAST-K.
The Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), located in Mumbai&the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology in Kashmir has signed a contract for using radiation technologies to enhance agricultural production.

The treaty was signed during a recent trip to BARC Mumbai by the SKUAST-K group of scientists, led by Vice-Chancellor Prof Nazir Ahmad Ganai.

The radiation technology would be included in the agricultural sector to help build innovative and different classes of crops by using the method of mutation breeding. This technology will help in prolonging the shelf life of freshly obtained vegetables and fruits and will also help in constructing new crop management technologies for organic agriculture.

The BARC Director Dr. AK Mohanty praised both the institutions for their mutual agreement during an interactive session.He also stated that Jammu and Kashmir would receive his full support strengthening human capacity in the zone of radioactive technology concerning the advancement of climate-smart improved varieties, particularly crops such as Kala Zeera, the wild tulip of Kashmir, saffron, and other plantations which represent the least amount of variability.

1160,"Smart Farms: A Step To Revolutionize Agri Sector With Revamping Techniques, AI & Data Analytics","Agtech's use of IoT, AI, and data analytics assists farmers in measuring key variables that aid in crop planning and increase food security. Agricultural technology helps farmers to boost productivity while cutting expenses.India is rapidly developing and for further growth, it must adapt to new technology. Farmers, who account for over 58 percent of the country's population, are still struggling to make ends meet due to the unpredictability of the monsoon, inadequate infrastructure, a lack of qualified labor, poor soil, and seed quality, and a lack of agricultural technology.

Agriculture is their sole source of income, and the majority of them still use traditional farming practices.

According to the World Economic Forum, the world population is predicted to reach 10 billion people by 2050, resulting in a 60% increase in food demand. There will not be enough arable land left to supply this demand at the current rate of ecological degradation, resulting in a food security problem and sustainability concerns.

Maximization Of Crop Yield
Farmers must employ measures that will assist them to increase their production to meet the ever-increasing global food demand. Growers will require a new agricultural technique and processes to raise more food in less land.

Agtech is a modern method of increasing output, quality, and profitability by combining agriculture with technology. In today's world, the agtech sector is booming, and it's helping to shape the agricultural industry's future.Food production, transportation, processing, and waste put enormous strain on natural resources. Crops are modified in such a manner that they can grow in any circumstance, resulting in a superior yield, using smart farming technologies such as hydroponics, remote farming, genetic modifications, aerial farming, vertical farming, drone technology, and so on. These next-generation approaches have the potential to reshape the agricultural experience and assist producers in meeting the rising demand for green and healthful crops.

Smart Farming Techniques To Revamp Agriculture
Agriculture practices that have been revamped can help produce healthier, fresher, and more nutritious food with a longer shelf life, resulting in a better ecosystem. Incorporating technology into agriculture reduces water and land waste while also giving farmers climate-controlled greenhouses to maximize crop yield and quality throughout the year. The technologies in question assist farmers in producing food without the use of toxic pesticides, and the output is also residue-free.

Farmers may now utilize smart cameras for real-time pest monitoring and action without damaging their crops thanks to new agricultural practices. Farmers may utilize thermal cameras to determine and control the increase in temperature and water stress in their crops.

A Chief Technology Officer, a specialized R&D team, plant scientists, microbiologists, mechanical engineers, and design engineers are all assigned to each smart farm. All of the experts join together to develop greens that are more sustainable, safer, and delicious.

Smart farms save space by using vertically stacked growing beds that use up less than 1% of the available space in highly populated metropolitan areas. Smart farms utilize 90 percent less water than conventional farming. Because most farms are located inside city borders, the average distribution time from harvest to table in 60 minutes, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Because vegetables may be cultivated indoors all year, smart farms guarantee stable prices.

Use Of Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics
Smart farms will utilize improved dehumidification techniques in the future to capture and condense moisture from the air to create water for hydroponic closed systems. Furthermore, the farm's power will be generated via solar panels. In the future, the entire farm will produce zero carbon emissions, making it one of the greatest examples of sustainable farming in the world.

Furthermore, the pandemic's devastating aftermath should serve as a stimulus for us to increase our knowledge and awareness, as well as contribute to the creation of a more efficient and sustainable food system. India's food system must be transformed if the country is to achieve its zero-hunger goal, and the innovative agtech industry appears to be up to the task.

The growing agtech business has the potential to save the country's struggling farmers. Retailers, exporters, and farmers may all benefit from smart techniques to contribute more to India's GDP than ever before. Healthy farming results in healthy products, which leads to a healthy lifestyle.",1

For India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, it is a high-priority sector. 

The government has established plans to develop it in a new way, moving away from conventional agriculture. All of this assures that the Budget meets the requirements of every Indian, from rural homes to chemical-free agriculture, a five-kilometer-wide corridor along the Ganges, and water for irrigation in Bundelkhand through the Ken-Betwa connection project. 

To supply digital and high-tech services to farmers, a new public-private partnership (PPP) scheme will be created. Crop evaluation, land record digitization, and pesticide and fertiliser spraying will all be done by ""Kisan Drones."" 

In the Budget, it was declared that a comprehensive scheme to encourage local oilseed production will be implemented. 

""A logical and thorough strategy would be implemented with the objective of increasing domestic oilseed output and reducing our reliance on imported oilseeds,"" said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. It is a balanced Budget for the agriculture sector, with infrastructure development, incentives, and technical incentives focusing on improving agriculture and farmers. 

Farmers and villages will be able to increase their earnings while also becoming self-sufficient. The year 2023 has been chosen by the government as the Year of Millets. Its goal is to create awareness about coarse cereal nutrition and farming in the face of changing climatic circumstances. 

Farmers would be paid the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 2.37 lakh crore immediately into their accounts. For the first time, government procurement is included in the budget proposal. The government's response is an appropriate response to those who spread MSP falsehoods. 

Chemical-free natural farming would be promoted across the country in the first stage, with a concentration on farmers' fields in 5-kilometer-wide corridors along the Ganges. 

For cooperatives, the alternative minimum tax payment has been decreased from 18.5 percent to 15%. ",1

1177,STUDENTS REIMAGINE RANCHER�S 30-YEAR-OLD CATTLE MARKET PREDICTION MODEL,"A group of students at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT) have developed software to help farmers better predict the cattle market.

The three students � Jordan Baumeister, Dustin Reff, and Trevor Borman � are computer science majors that used artificial intelligence and data science to create models predicting future market trends. These models also provide a comparison for anomalies, like droughts or floods, using historical data trends. 

�Our overall goal was to optimize the risk versus reward tradeoff that shows up when you exchange these contracts on the futures market,� Reff says.

The idea to create a model like this came from Ron Ragsdale, a rancher who worked with SDSMT student Todd Gange in 1993. Ragsdale had created a system for calculating predictions of the cattle market on pen and paper, using a series of equations. 

�What he did was genius,� Gagne says. �He looked at the futures market for both cattle and corn and backed out all the costs needed to fatten his calves. He used 187 variables, not just feed. He included the costs of the lights in his barn, vaccination, and fuel. This way, he knew what he could pay for his calves to make a profit in the future.�

Gange helped Ragsdale optimize his system using a computer program Gange and his wife Holly had created in college. Ragsdale�s method, combined with Gange�s program, failed to produce accurate results only twice. 

Ragsdale passed away in 2021 before he was able to publish his thesis on market theory. Before his death, Gange and Ragsdale launched a student program, and Gange passed his software on to a new team of SDSMT students. 

The goal of this new team � Baumeister, Reff, and Borman � was to take modern tools like AI and enhance the old program, making it more robust and better able to predict factors that may drive the market off its typical course. 

�If I know what the value should be in the future, what happens when something like mad cow disease, widespread drought, or widespread flooding occurs? All these things can send the market into arbitrage,� Gagne says. �We twisted and turned this data and tried to look at it in new ways to see anomalies or patterns that we think are tradable in the future.�

The team created two prediction models: one that evaluates the historical data trends to determine risk vs. reward and one that predicts the best times to buy and sell. 

The project is still ongoing. The three students have graduated but will coach the next team in the fall to begin the next phase of the project. Next semester�s students will rebuild the models and determine which of Ragsdale�s 187 variables are the most important in predicting the markets and build in indicators for over- or undervalued animals. 

""As a sponsor, Todd provided years of data, support, and a good story,� says Brian Butterfield, a lecturer of computer science and engineering at Mines. �These students took advantage of the opportunity by applying their skills in data science and data analysis to advance the work. I appreciate watching what emerges by providing students with the framework to build something and gain real-world experience.""",1

1179,HOW DAIRY COW MONITORING SYSTEMS BENEFIT THE BOTTOM LINE,"Dairy cow monitoring is serious business at Pagel�s Ponderosa Dairy in Kewaunee, Wisconsin.

The 6,250 milking cows at one of the two farms are outfitted with a monitoring collar as soon as they reach the farm and carry that monitor throughout their time on the farm. These monitors collect data 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing invaluable information that helps the farm better manage the herd.

�It�s an incredibly valuable tool for us,� says Chris Szydel, dairy herd manager for Pagel�s. �Instead of looking for animals that might need attention, the computer comes up with a list and identifies those animals. The response time with the system is the fastest way that we can identify those animals.�

Herd monitoring systems have been a part of some operations for several decades, but the technology is getting smarter, providing loads of specific information that may not be readily apparent upon visual inspection of the animal.

As the technology advances, data provides even more insight into the daily life of a cow and what producers can do to make that animal more productive.

Heat detection systems were the first significant uses of remote monitoring systems. Because of the critical nature of ensuring efficient breeding, usage dramatically increased.

Today, monitoring has become more precise, gauging everything from rumination time, respiration, eating time, inactivity, and location.

LEAVE THEM ALONE
While data from cow monitoring systems can help identify stressed cows, perhaps the system�s most prominent feature is that it identifies animals that don�t need attention.

�This is a pivotal technology for the 3% to 5% of animals who need our attention,� says Brandt Kreuscher, dairy business development manager for Allflex Livestock Intelligence. �But the heart of monitoring systems and artificial intelligence is to leave 95% of the animals alone to go about their daily business without human interaction.�

The broader impact is to not handle animals that don�t need any assistance.

�The bottom line is that there is very little that you can do to increase production in a healthy animal by unnecessarily getting them out of their daily routines,� Kreuscher says. �A lot of the gains we see in herd health and production is in not handling the healthy cow,� he adds. �Where we really see this issue come to light is in the transition period. If we are doing intensive things like locking them up to take temperatures or run urine ketosis strips, soon we have the cows locked up for a considerable amount of time each day.�

Letting cows be cows is why cow location features are helpful.

�The herd manager can walk straight into a pen and find the one cow that needs assistance, without disrupting the rest of the cows� routine,� says Tera Baker, marketing manager for Nedap.

Monitoring identifies those cows that need assistance in the fresh pen, while leaving the remaining cows alone. Less handling of fresh cows translates to production throughout the lactation period, which means more milk.

�Monitoring systems provide information on the cow 24-7, and present the producer with actionable insights on cows that need attention,� says Gerard Griffioen, founder of CowManager. �It also means there are cows that are not on the list. You have total control of your herd with detailed, classified information.�",1
1182,PERSONALIZED WEATHER TECHNOLOGY,"My dad always used to say, �When it rained 40 days and 40 nights, we only got two-tenths�. Weather forecasts from the National Weather Service encompass a broad area. Sometimes the temperature or rainfall in one part of your county is vastly different from what happens on your farm, which can make daily management decisions tricky. 

A new company called Benchmark Labs in California has developed a system to target weather forecasts for your specific location. CEO Carlos Gaitan says they use data coming from loT sensors on your farm that monitor environmental conditions.  

""It�s hardware that combines many sensors that record. Usually relative humidity, temperature, wind speed and direction, maybe solar radiation pressure,"" says Gaitan. ""We get information from the farms with these sensors and then we correct the forecast of the national weather agencies all over the world to match, or to be more accurate, more reflective, of the conditions at the farm level.""
 
Web and phone apps will give real-time data and weather forecasts. 

""We use the core information from the IoT sensors, but we also get data from the National Weather Service to provide a forecast up to 10 days into the future at the hourly level,"" he says. ""Farmers care deeply about what is going to happen over the next 24 hours, and we provide them a forecast for those variables for the next day. And then in the web and mobile app, they can see the forecast for the next 10 days.""

Gaitan says this technology can improve the accuracy of weather forecasts at your location by as much as 60%.",1
1186,CYBERSECURITY ON THE FARM,"Doug:
I think there's a couple factors. Biggest one is they figured out how to make money. They figured out it's fairly easy money to make with limited risk of any bad consequences. And in a part that's facilitated by things like Bitcoin, the ability to easily transfer money from one person to another anonymously. So that's why they're going after some of the big targets. Some of the big people who are going to pay millions of dollars to come back. And they still go after individuals, trying to get them to give up gift cards or other ways to do that payment, so. But motivation is driven by money.
Jodi:
Farmers in rural areas may think, ""Ah, this isn't going to happen to me."" But how are farmers being targeted by the cybersecurity attackers?
Doug:
Well, so sort of again, two categories, I think we look at everybody's being targeted in general. They don't care if you're a farmer.
Jodi:
True.
Doug:
You own a restaurant or whoever. So there's a group of them out there that are just going to cast a wide net and see who falls or whatever scam they're pushing at the moment. But we are starting to see, especially looking at the recent things with co-ops, et cetera, they've sort of discovered the ag sector. When you've seen this over the last several years.
Doug:
They moved from sector to sector as a sector starts to realize that they're after them, the sector starts to communicate and harden their defenses and people know, ""Oh, the hospital down the street got hit. We need to be better prepared."" And so they kind of drift, they were financial for a while. They're still in hospitals, but they played against hospitals. There was a period of time when they went after cities, municipalities, ag seems to be one that they're kind of waking up to when they go after the big organizations, the co-ops or the banks.
Jodi:
Who are they going after in agriculture right now, you think?
Doug:
And we've seen some cases recently especially if you look at the ransomware attack, which is the big money attack, they're going after people who they believe cannot function if their computer systems quit working, that's what makes ransomware work. And so it was JBS a while back and the big one, which wasn't ag, but the colonial pipeline is the perfect example of a kind of we are in the east coast for a week. Because what ransomware does is it stops your ability, use your computer systems.
Doug:
And so they're trying to figure out who's most impacted by that. They went after a couple co-ops here in Iowa that made the news and how successful things are really depends on how can you operate? Do you have a backup plan to operate without a computer system? I mean, co-ops are in a little better position to do that than a hospital can't operate without a computer. So they're just out of luck without computers. So part of it, is they're just kind of drifting around. Cause that's if you're looking at the big attacks they're still after anybody who falls for that.
Jodi:
Yeah. And a lot of that comes through our email system of course.
Doug:
Oh, yes.
Jodi:
So what are some tips that you have to prevent downloading this malware?
Doug:
Yeah, so it's a hard tip to tell people, but you tell people to be leery. We by our very nature like to be trusting. And so you want to be a little suspicious of anything that comes across unsolicited and email tends to be one of their biggest methods to do that. And now they're doing more of emails to get you to go somewhere or to actively participate in the download. We don't see as much sending the malware as an email attachment in part we have technology that does a pretty good job of stopping that. So now they're through social engineering trying to trick you convince you to download malware. And the bottom line is that if it's unsolicited be very suspicious of it, they tend to try to be trusted partner or they try to pretend to be your bank or something else.
Doug:
Know your bank will never tell you to do that. No legitimate business is going to tell you to come and download something. One of the things they play the game of, well, you need to download this viewer in order to see this content. No, you don't. There's no special content that needs a viewer. Bottom line is you basically don't really ever need to download anything that is an executable. It's okay to download a PDF file and look at it. But the other word of advice, your computers are pretty good at trying to stop you from doing bad things, they pop up the little messages and say, ""Do you really want to open this? Do you really want to do this?"" When it's asking you that question, it's trying to protect you. It's not trying to annoy you. So look at what it's saying. Think about what it's asking. Oftentimes the answer is no, but sometimes we get frustrated with the computer constantly doing that.
Jodi:
Can you explain what phishing emails are and how to identify one?
Doug:
Yeah, well phishing, and there's actually several flavors of phishing. So if we look at just general phishing, those are the emails that are pretty generic in nature. They'll pretend to be your bank. They'll have a backstory of why you should do something. Usually it's your account's been compromised, sometimes it's you've won a prize. So the whole two sides of that, if it's too good to be true. Yes, it probably is. The other side is the banks and they aren't going to send you messages like that, telling you things have been compromised. If something's been compromised, they'll reach out with you over a phone call.
Doug:
So phishing is really this idea of trying to convince you to do something. And then the phishing gets, they talk about spear phishing. They talk about phishing that gets more focus. So that would be, they know you're a farmer and now they're going to pretend to be a co-op versus they don't know who you are. And half the time you may even get an email from a bank you don't even do business with. So they don't even know anything about you. So they range from they're just trying to get anybody who will answer to. Yeah, I know this person is likely a farmer. Therefore, I'm pretending to be a co-op in the area or I'm pretending to be something a little more generic and trying to again, convince you to do something.
Jodi:
Despite your best intentions, sometimes you still can fall a victim to a very cleverly crafted email. Doug, what do you do if you fall victim to malware or a phishing email?
Doug:
A little bit depends on what you fall victim to. The phishing emails try to typically get you to do one of two things, download the malware. And if you have fallen victim and download malware, basically you want to unplug your computer from the network and then find expert advice to help get it back. I mean, if you've gotten ransomware on your computer, you're going to need to turn to professionals to help you work through that. You should have backups, et cetera ahead of time.
Doug:
So if you have Cloud based backups. Yeah, it's chances of coming back are pretty good for an individual. The other things they try to do a lot of is they'll get your username and password to something. So they'll pretend to be your bank. You'll log into your, what they say is your bank. And you give up your username and password. If you fallen victim to that, then you need to contact the bank. You need to go in and change usernames and passwords. And if you've used that password anywhere else, you better change it everywhere else you've used it.
Jodi:
Let's talk about the importance of strong passwords. How do you create one? What is a strong password and where do you store them? I mean, everybody needs a password for this or that and the other thing, it gets to be quite a pain.
Doug:
Yeah, it is quite a pain. Depending on how many you have let's start with where do you store them? I mean, I use an electronic storage mechanism for my passwords. It's a monthly charge to do that. But when I think about an electronic storage, I'm actually worried about two issues with my passwords. One is I can't remember them. But the other is in the case of something really bad happening, how does my family recover from me not being there anymore? So many of these password systems have the ability to have multiple users. So you got that whole, what if something really bad happens? If you have a smaller number of passwords, it's actually not terrible to write them down in a notebook and put them in your desk in your locked house. That's not a terrible thing.
Doug:
It's just, you get to the point where there's so many of them and it becomes kind of unwielding. Good passwords, it's really about how long they are more than how weird they are. So if you think about guessing a password, either through just guessing, because I know your cat's name is Fluffy, verses guessing because I'm going to try all the possible words in the English dictionary. If I make a password that is long made up of multiple words, even if they're just all normal words that becomes a strong password. Cause I can't guess it.
Doug:
Now some places force you to add upper lower case and special characters, but really length is the most important thing we talk about. Cause there's two sides to losing your password. There is somebody guesses Fluffy. The other is that your passwords are stored on various places and they can get broken into and they will lose the passwords. Now the passwords are designed in such a way that they can't get them without guessing all possible combinations against that. So you have to guess Fluffy, but they can guess Fluffy with a piece of software. So again, that's why you want a really long password because their software can't guess that.
Jodi:
You alluded to a saving what's on your computer earlier. What are your tips for backing up your data?
Doug:
Various Cloud storage is a good mechanism. If you feel comfortable with that, Google Drive, any of those Google or any service like that, if you feel comfortable with doing it yourself, hard drives you go by at your favorite store cost almost nothing. A little external hard drive. The downside of an external hard drive is again in disaster recovery. So we kind of also worry about disaster and cyber recovery. If my hard drive is sitting next to my laptop and a tornado blows through, like happens periodically and wipes out my house, my hard drive goes away too. So the beauty of the Cloud storage is that it's stored somewhere.
Jodi:
And none of us know where it is.
Doug:
Yeah, right.
Doug:
Well, but the point is that they then take care of backing up redundancy, et cetera. And the Cloud isn't in one place. It literally is all over the country. And so your data is very well protected by being part of the Cloud. And for most people we don't have enough data to really have it cost a whole lot. Most Cloud services have a pretty low cost for quite a bit of data. Same with your phone. My phone is automatically backed up to the same Cloud storage that I have my computer connected to for all the pictures and stuff. I don't want to worry about losing my pictures on my phone. And so they're in the Cloud. The beauty of that too, is that I can also get at them from my computer. So I can see my phone pictures on my computer, which is kind of nice.
Jodi:
Are you seeing cybersecurity issues with machinery technology at all?
Doug:
We're not seeing it in the ag sector yet and especially at a farm level. Cause most of it's not highly automated. You see some automation at processing facilities, but even like a JBS who got hit most of their factory floor is fairly straightforward and mechanic. I mean it's conveyor belts moving at a fixed rate. You get into people that are doing more of a distillery or more of a complex chemical process, but they've done a good job of segmentation. Your factory floor is not on the internet. It's all by itself.
Jodi:
Okay. So then a farmer who has advanced technology in his tractors, he's going through the field. Doesn't have to worry about a hacker getting into that and messing with all his data.
Doug:
Messing with the tractor probably not, the little kid somewhere is not going to take over control your tractor. But if you start to store all of your field data, et cetera in your Cloud account, then you want to make sure you have multifactor authentication in front of your accounts. Everybody hates it, username password, and then it sends you a text message. But that was a word of advice for anything that's important. You want to talk about making your passwords secure, multifactor does that. I can give you my password to my bank. Won't do you any good unless you have my cell phone. And so any of that critical data and most data services, some of them force you. I can't deal with my bank on unless it's multifactor, they won't let me. So worrying about any of that critical data that you're storing use multifactor use your cell phone as your second factor, because that's really where the threat is losing that data.
Jodi:
Doug, are there any other tips that you'd like to pass along for keeping farmers up to date on any cyber security issues?
Doug:
Well, we've focused a lot on things coming in through the email. You need to be also very leery of they're using text messages, they're using the telephone. As we teach people or people learn how to not do this, that doesn't stop them. They just figure out a new something to do to you. And so the text messages have actually been on the increase using the links to web pages. And so inside text messages, they will do some amount of phone that kind of ebbs and flows because it costs them a lot, not in money, but time to interact with you and basically they're trying to convince you to download malware when they talk to you on the phone. All though there have been cases where they try to play the game, ""Grandson has been arrested for OWI and you need to give us money."" And those things.
Doug:
We see some of that, but we're also seeing a willingness for them to interact more with you. We've seen some simple emails go back and forth. The, ""Hey are you free? Do you have a minute."" Pretending to be one of your friends. And that typically eventually leads to them, trying to get gift cards out of you. I don't know by you, but I don't think I have any friends who would send multiple emails back and forth to get gift cards from me. If they needed money from me, they would pick up the phone and call me and I'd gladly give them money.
Jodi:
Yeah and I'd call them back to make sure it was really them.
Doug:
Yes, exactly. But we're not going to play 15 emails back and forth to give $500 worth of gift cards that just ain't going to happen.
Jodi:
All right. Well thank you very much, Doug. And I guess the words here are, if it's too good to be true, it probably is. So coming through something like that.
Doug:
Yeah. I mean, it really is the fact, I mean the computer in some sense is almost the perfect vehicle for this to happen. Because we don't associate it with people. It's our, we only bought the thing. It's ours, it's sitting on our desk, it's in our house. What we don't understand is all this is a way for people to talk to us and it's no different than the stranger walking up to on the street with the trench coat and all the watches. But we, for some reason and right probably, we disassociate the person on the other end because the computer's there. And so we will do things, say things we'll even post things that we would never do say face to face to somebody.
Doug:
So I always, and this is more when I'm dealing with the younger people, but I always use what would grandma think if you posted that, if you did that or would you do this? If somebody walked up to you face to face and asked you to do this, would you? And if the answer, no, then it's probably should be no across the computer.",1
1190,AN ELECTRIC TRACTOR MAY BE IN YOUR FUTURE,"It�s been nearly 30 years since Steve Heckeroth designed and built his first electric tractor. Since then, he�s converted diesel tractors to electric power, custom-built electric tractors, and assembled an experimental electric tractor for Ford New Holland as early as 1995. Today, as founder of Solectrac, Heckeroth is finally seeing electric tractors taken seriously by both customers and other manufacturers.

California-based Solectrac has sold about two dozen of its battery-powered tractors since 2018 and has accumulated about $1 million worth of back orders because of pandemic-related issues.

�The biggest problem with electric cars is the weight of the batteries,� says Heckeroth, who has a background in solar power and electric vehicles. �I realized very quickly that weight on a tractor is actually an asset that improves traction.�

More than 14 countries and over 20 cities have proposed or enacted bans on the sale of cars, and in some cases light trucks, powered by fossil fuels; the bans will go into effect from five to 20 years from now. Heckeroth expects a ban on small gasoline- and diesel-powered tractors to follow, especially in large cities. The push to reduce air pollution is primarily driving the market, but he lists a number of benefits an electric tractor offers over its diesel counterpart.

�In addition to being cleaner and quieter, an electric tractor is much more efficient, since all the energy goes into work; whereas, in a diesel tractor, much of it is wasted as heat,� he explains. �In addition, maximum torque is available immediately rather than at rated engine speed. Finally, since the power source has just one moving part, they require very little maintenance. Even the batteries are projected to last 10 years, pending operating cycles and depth of discharge.�

Solectrac currently offers a 30-hp. compact and a 40-hp. utility model. The company just introduced a 70-hp. vineyard and orchard tractor, which addresses the specific needs of that specialty market with its narrow width and greater horsepower.MONARCH TRACTOR
Equipped with an electric drivetrain capable of providing 40 hp. of continuous power and short-duration peak power up to 70 hp., the Monarch combines electrification, automation, machine learning, and data analysis to bring a fully electric, driver-optional, smart tractor to the farm in a single platform.

�Monarch Tractor is moving farming toward a safer, sustainable future by eliminating harmful emissions, reducing the need for herbicides, and keeping workers out of harm�s way with its driver-optional capabilities,� says Carl Mondavi, Monarch Tractor chief farming officer.The California company recently received a minority investment from CNH Industrial that will share Monarch Tractor�s electric and autonomous tractor technology across CNH�s portfolio of ag brands.

�This partnership underscores our commitment to rapidly improving our alternative propulsion and precision-farming portfolio, while extending our world-leading sustainability credentials,� says Scott Wine, CEO, CNH Industrial.

KUBOTA PROTOTYPES
Kubota recently released two prototype machines powered by lithium-ion batteries that will be tested in France later this year. One is a compact tractor, while the other is a mini excavator. The company says the maximum output of both machines will be equivalent to that of models with diesel engines.FENDT E100 VARIO
AGCO has looked to its Fendt division to take the lead in electric tractor production. The company has already developed a 75-kW (100 hp.) electric tractor. Known as the Fendt e100 Vario, the all-electric compact tractor operates up to 10 hours under actual operating conditions and can be recharged to 80% in just 40 minutes.�The technology developed by the auto industry has been a big driver in development of electric tractors,� says Tom Turner, AGCO strategic marketing manager for high-horsepower tractors, pointing to higher-capacity batteries with faster charging cycles. �Now, we�re just trying to get ahead of the curve.

�The Fendt e100 is similar in size and power to the Fendt 200,� he adds. �Thanks to its quiet and emissions-free operation, we see real potential for an electric tractor that size, particularly among small farms and livestock operations and for use in urban and residential areas. Compact tractors aren�t typically used a long distance from home or the shop; they often spend a fair amount of time idle.�

Like Heckeroth, Turner points out that an electric tractor eliminates the cost of fuel, oil, DEF, etc., and the batteries can be charged via renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind power for an even lower cost of operation. Thanks to the three-point hitch, hydraulic remote valves, and PTO, an electric tractor can operate any existing implement as well as electric-powered implements being developed.

JOHN DEERE GRIDCON
Unfortunately, Turner doesn�t see electric tractors going much higher than 100 hp. or much longer than a few hours on a charge with current technology. John Deere has attempted to remedy those issues with its cable-powered prototype GridCON. Unlike its earlier battery-powered prototypes, the fully electric, autonomous tractor provides up to 400 hp. (300 kW) and is powered by an electric cable connection from the field border to the tractor via a drum that carries more than 1,000 yards of cable.�The biggest challenge for battery electric tractors is available energy capacity in batteries today compared with the energy required for typical farming operations,� says Dennis Muszalski, director, module and electrification system engineering, John Deere. �During the critical windows of planting and harvesting, availability of equipment is paramount. Our customers can�t afford any delays due to limitations of battery capacity resulting in frequent and lengthy recharging.�

Although prices aren�t available yet for prototype models, the Monarch has a base price of $50,000. Solectrac tractors currently list for about 20% more than a comparable diesel model. However, the lower maintenance costs should offset much of that.",1

1206,CAN TECH SOLVE THE BEE PROBLEM?,"Omer Davidi and Itai Kanot founded BeeHero after asking a simple question: Can technology help solve the problems bees face? Colony collapse disorder, disease, and fewer resources prevent bees from pollinating the $15 billion worth of crops each year, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. Davidi, a tech entrepreneur, and Kanot, a second-generation commercial beekeeper, then followed up that question with a second: How could they optimize pollination cycles to increase yields for farmers?

�We�ve focused on pollination because it doesn�t really matter the kind of crop we�re talking about. The question of whether a flower will be pollinated and turn into something farmers can monetize is a question of probability,� says Davidi.

READ MORE: Planning for pollinators
Based in Israel and California, BeeHero has developed in-hive sensors to monitor and collect data about the environment, pollination performance, and hive health. They analyze approximately 30 data points to predict the quality of pollination and partner with beekeepers and farmers for �pollination as a service.�

HOW IT WORKS
In-hive sensors are positioned in the middle frame of a colony to collect information like presence of disease, food availability, humidity, temperature, amount of pollen brought into the colony, etc. The sensors send this data to the cloud, it is run through computational models, and BeeHero can then predict any disorders, all accessible to beekeepers via an online dashboard. Davidi explains, �It�s just like a blood test; we have the ability to do early detection. If we notice something is wrong and don�t see the consequences already, then we can prevent damage and make sure the bees have the right conditions in order to thrive.�

READ MORE: What kind of bee is that?
Taking it a step further, BeeHero analyzes the best way to deploy hives for pollination. This is how farmers can track and monitor the cycle in real-time and ensure their crops are successfully pollinated.

�Having some biological boundaries like the flying pattern of the bee, the amount of pollen they bring into the colony, and measurements of pollination around the hive, we can determine what percentage of flowers will be pollinated,� explains Davidi. �It�s amazing to see now that we have results from several different crops for how the positioning of the hive affects the quality of pollination and results in a 20% to 30% increase in most crops.�

INTERNET OF THINGS IN AGRICULTURE
Internet of Things (IoT) companies providing solutions to the ag industry face challenges to deploy their technology. The lack of network coverage across rural, remote areas, and over hundreds of miles of farmland is a significant obstacle for BeeHero to collect and process the data they need. To combat this, BeeHero works with Soracom, a cellular connectivity provider that specializes in IoT and provides coverage across multiple networks and bands.

The constantly changing environments and fleeting windows of opportunity make IoT even more difficult to manage. �Developers have to be running quickly and sometimes they don�t have the time, especially if field testing might be dependent upon a growing season,� says Kenta Yasukawa, cofounder and CTO of Soracom. �If you miss that window, you�re down for a year.�

Soracom�s platform allows BeeHero to get devices online quickly and control their entire network directly, which is especially important as they connect and control tens of thousands of devices on the ground to the cloud.

�Pollination doesn�t have to be a bet,� remarks Davidi. �It can be something much more stable and much more efficient.�

1208,HOW AG BUSINESSES DELIVER ON THEIR COMMITMENTS TO SUSTAINABILITY,"At the World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit, leaders from Land O�Lakes, The Nature Conservancy, Cargill, and General Mills discuss how their business models and partnerships drive sustainability forward.

One resounding message is the need for �radical collaboration� across the industry, to move the needle forward for the farmer and environment.

The panelists include:

Moderator A.G. Kawamura, former secretary of the California Dept. of Food and Ag
Teddy Bekele, chief technology officer at Land O�Lakes
Jennifer Morris, chief executive officer of The Nature Conservancy
Ruth Kimmelshue, head of business operations supply chain and chief sustainability officer at Cargill
John Church, chief supply chain officer at General Mills
�The farmer is the original environmentalist,� says Bekele. �Farmers want to do right by the land from one generation to the next, but at the same time, by augmenting their profit and loss, there is further incentive to put soil health practices into place.�

Bekele cites Land O�Lakes� network of ag retailers who work closely with farmers on conservation practices and the company�s recent alliance with Microsoft to sequester carbon as two ways they are working to solve climate variability.

The past year in the food and ag industries also proved the value of collaboration.

�During the pandemic, all of our supply chains moved on a dime,� says Church. �As we look back, it�s proven that because of partnerships, we can collaborate up and down the supply chain.�

Church says that a similar response is necessary to address climate change challenges and it starts by finding common ground.

The Nature Conservancy (TNC) also leverages partnerships across the industry to create new markets. For example, TNC, McDonald�s, Cargill, and Target together launched a five-year $8.5 million project in August 2020 to support Nebraska farmers in implementing soil health practices with technical and financial assistance. The project has the potential to sequester 150,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

�In the United States, American ranchers and farmers are stewarding over 800 million acres,� Morris says. �With that kind of scale, agriculture can be one of our greatest levers for restoring the health of the planet.�

READ MORE: The Nature Conservancy invests in five ag tech companies

While partnerships are essential for a sustainable future, so is technology.

�It will take investments and incentives now to show what can be done in terms of regenerative agriculture,� Morris says. �I�m particularly hopeful that tech innovations will help us accelerate progress in ways we�ve never been able to before and to get those on farms.�

�Tech is embedded into the way we do work,� Bekele says. �It is part of selecting the right seed for the soil, choosing and implementing the right practices to apply to that seed, and the way farmers perform work every day.�",1
796714,Compensate Telangana farmers immediately for crop loss: Farm activists,"The Rythu Swarajya Vedika called on both Centre and state, to bury their hatchet and ensure disaster relief to lakhs of affected farmers

Activists of Rythu Swarajya Vedika (From Left to Right) Kanneganti Ravi, Kiran Vissa, P Shankar, Dalit Bahujan Front and B Kondal Reddy, convenor of RSV addressing a press conference July 23, 2022. Photo: G Ram Mohan

The farmers of Telangana have faced unprecedented crop losses in the wake of heavy rains and floods this month. The government should immediately compensate them, an independent farmers’ organisation based in the two Telugu states said July 23, 2022.

Activists of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) also called out the Telangana government’s policies towards farmers.

They addressed a press conference in Hyderabad where they released a factsheet on the claims made by the state and the Centre. The claims dealt with disaster relief, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

The organisation called on both the Centre and state, who have been engaged in a political slugfest, to bury the hatchet and ensure that disaster relief reaches lakhs of affected farmers.

Telangana has been hit by flooding twice in a fortnight now. The first round of flooding happened around July 15 along the Godavari river. On July 22 and 23, heavy rains inundated low-lying areas in Hyderabad and its neighbouring districts such as Medak, Sangareddy and Mahbubabad.

The Met Department has said Telangana is set to get more rains over the next three days. The state’s north and north-eastern districts are set to receive heavy rains and a red alert has been issued for north Telangana districts, Met Department director K Nagaratna told this reporter.

“Up to 20 centimetres of rain is expected in some places. We have given a flood warning for the state. As of now, we have received 119 per cent rainfall and Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts have received highest rains,” she added.

Flawed policies

The RSV expressed concern over extensive damage to cotton, maize, soyabean and red gram crops due to the heavy rains and overflowing waterbodies.

The activists cited preliminary reports of crop damages over 445,154 hectares across the state. They sought immediate enumeration of crops, livestock and lands affected.

They also criticised the government’s lack of data regarding tenant farmers.

“Details of actual cultivators including tenant farmers should be noted down immediately. The Telangana government has refused to implement the Licensed Cultivators Act 2011 and failed to identify lakhs of tenant farmers,” Kiran Vissa, from the RSV, who is in the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said.

“It would be difficult for the government to zero in on tenant farmers and pay compensation in the future if not done soon. Not doing so now would only lead to the government taking the plea of being too late,” he added.

The activists also took exception to giving a go-by to the standard practice of farmer-wise enumeration of crop loss immediately after a disaster.

They said this had led to a handicap even when funds were available. Compensation was provided in 2018 in Adilabad and Khammam districts purely owing to the initiative of the district collectors as they had data and most of the amount went to those districts, the RSV said.

They also highlighted the issue of crop insurance schemes. Telangana exited the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana from the kharif season of 2020.

However, it had failed to establish its own schemes unlike other states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Its farmers thus had not received any compensation despite heavy losses.

Kanneganti Ravi, RSV activist said taking the Telangana government to the High Court for the State of Telangana twice over the past four years over payment of compensation to farmers had not resulted in changing its attitude. In 2018, it was forced to distribute a meagre Rs 23 crore as input subsidy.

“The state went on appeal to the Supreme Court after it lost the case and failed to pay the Rs 188.23 crore for crop losses approved by the Centre between July and September 2021. This despite the state’s crop damage assessment of Rs 552 crore according to the NDRF scale of relief,” Ravi said.

He added that this exposed the claims of generosity by the Centre to the state. “The state government’s failure to fulfil its promise to waive farmers loans has resulted in denial of fresh loans from banks to farmers,” he added.

Telangana has failed to adhere to norms laid down according to guidelines issued in July 2015 and failed to submit reports of expenditure incurred.

Funds according to norms are released by the NDRF, subject to spending of 50 per cent of funds available with the SDRF.

As the SDRF had Rs 977 crore on March 31, 2020 (according to the state accountant general’s letter) and the approved Rs 245.96 crore was less than 50 per cent of the amount, new funds were not released by the Centre. This laid bare, the claim of lack of central assistance for disasters, the RSV factsheet said.

It further said the state government had made mutually contradictory statements in the apex court. It claimed lack of assistance from the Centre despite submission of damages.

At the same time, it said the entire affected crop was recovered completely in October 2020. It thus deduced no need for compensation payment and added that it was too late to identify the farmers now.

This stand has continued despite pronouncements by the state agriculture minister. He had made them after visiting chilli and fruit farmers in Warangal in the aftermath of a hailstorm in January 2022.

Chief Minister K Chandra Sekhar Rao had also seconded this proposal. But farmers are yet to receive any compensation.

The RSV also pooh-poohed the claims of the Telangana government over non-cooperation by the Centre in disbursal of relief funds. They showed a letter from the accountant general to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as proof.

The letter noted the SDRF had a balance of Rs 977 crore on April 1, 2020. It also received Rs 449 crore from the Centre for 2020-21, Rs 149.67 crore from the state for 2020-21 and Rs 10,005 crore diverted from the Telangana Building and Other Workers Welfare Board, which is said to be against established norms.

The RSV said the state should immediately submit its pending accounts for earlier expenditure from SDRF and their current status. If the funds have been spent on Covid pandemic relief, the same should be made public. They also called on the Centre to immediately release full assistance for disaster relief.

Farmers’ incomes have more than doubled, as the government had promised in 2016, the Centre claimed in Parliament July 19, 2022. But it did not give any figures or details on how this happened and what are the current income levels.

The claim was made by the Union Minister for Agriculture, Narendra Singh Tomar, in a written reply in the Lok Sabha to a series of questions asked by the Congress Member of Parliament Manish Tewari on whether farmers’ income has doubled in the last six years.

The promise was first made six years ago by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Replying to this, Tomar listed a series of initiatives taken to improve incomes and said, “The efforts of the government for positive implementation of these schemes are yielding huge results,”

“The income of the farmers is continuously improving. It has been seen that it has more than doubled,”

he added.

But he did not give any state-wise or country-wise data on this. He instead referenced a recent book released by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, which documented cases of 75,000 farmers who have increased their income more than two times.

India has 146.19 million operational holdings, according to Agriculture Ministry’s last input survey for 2016-17.

The benchmark estimated annual income was Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 which was taken as a base year, according to the government’s DFI (doubling farmers’ income) report.

This comes to be Rs 8,059 per month, which was promised to be doubled in real terms to Rs 21,146 per month, taking inflation into account by 2022.

To a question on this, Tomar, curiously, stated the figures from the National Sample Survey Office’s 77th Round of Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households released in 2021.

It underscores farmers' monthly income at only Rs 10,218 per month, half of the minister was claiming.

The surveys were from the agriculture year July 2018 to June 2019. The agriculture minister failed to explain if the substantial jump from Rs 10,218 to Rs 21,146 happened in the last two years alone.

“In response to a starred question of mine, the Agriculture Minister has made an astounding claim —Farm Incomes have doubled between 2016 -2022. If the matter wouldn’t have concerned lives & livelihoods of 82 crore Indians it would have been laughable,” Tewari later said in a post on social media.

Last week, Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah sought support from Agricultural Rural Development Banks to fulfil Modi’s vision of doubling farmers’ income and stressed the need for expansion of long-term finance for the development of the agriculture sector.",1
796823,Onion crisis: ‘High time Union govt invested in low-cost storage’,"Country director, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics talks to DTE on onion price volatality, amendement to Essential Commodities Act, 1955

It is a crisis that repeats itself year after year: A poor yield of onion crop leads to supply crunch — and a sharp spike in its price. The Union government on September 18, 2020 issued a notification prohibiting the export of onions to check the spiralling prices.

Being a key crop, onion often suffers from supply crunch and price volatility.

Arabinda Kumar Padhee, country director, India, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics, spoke to Down to Earth on the price volatility of the crop, inadequate storage facilities and amendment to Essential Commodities Act, 1955 that deregulated several commodities including cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, among others.

Snigdha Das: Why are onion prices so volatile?

Arabinda Kumar Padhee: India is one of the largest producers as well as consumers of onion across the world. Still, we often see a cycle of onion crisis every second or third year. The reasons ascribed to such situation are many.

Production shocks are, in many instances, related to weather-related events. For example, in late 2019, the excessive rainfall during monsoons damaged the kharif crop, creating shortage of the most important vegetable and spiralling of its price.

Proper crisis management by stakeholder ministries with advance planning is crucial. This is evident from the fact that imported onions in 2019 could not be utilised on time.

Inadequate storage facilities and stock-holding limits fixed by authorities according to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 are also major reasons for the crisis.

I would like to add another dimension to the problem. As general elections draw closer in any state, the price of onion becomes an issue and policies around it get mired in politics.

SD: Do onions require special storage?

AKP: Yes, indeed. From my own experience as a development practitioner, I would take the inadequate storage structures as the main reason for the demand-supply gap.

As a district collector in a few tribal districts of Odisha, I have seen how even poor and marginalised cultivators keep the little quantity of their surplus harvest in traditional onion storage structures.

It is high time that the Union government promotes and invests in low-cost storage structures as well as private sector investments in post-harvest storage facilities. Significant quantities of onions get wasted for want of good pre- and post-harvest practices.

Buffer stocking by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd and state agencies could stabilise the price situation. Collection of credible data on area and production and market arrivals of onion could inform the policy space better in proper planning.

Farmer producer organisations in the sector could play an important role in the present context.

SD: What do you have to say on the export ban on onions?

AKP: As we speak, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 has been amended taking onion, potato and few other commodities out of its purview. Imposition of stock limits (to prevent hoarding) have not met desired outcomes in case of onions.

Another thing that the Union government must do to regain confidence of farmers and traders is to lift the ban on the export of onions.

In my view, the ban is regressive and needs rethinking. A stable agri-exports policy would, in fact, be in the larger interest of farming communities. Effective and proactive coordination between stakeholder ministries such as the commerce, agriculture, consumer affairs, etc as well as state governments and trade bodies will be rewarding.

SD: Other countries have promoted cultivars of longer shelf life. Why not India?

AKP: The national agricultural research system, including private sector companies, should intensify efforts for development of new varieties with a longer shelf life and other desired characteristics.

Productivity of onion crop in India, as compared to countries such as China, Egypt and the United States is also quite low. Moreover, production of onion in India is limited to a fewer states. This needs to be diversified to non-traditional areas with specific mission-mode interventions.

SD: What kinds of onions have a longer shelf life — processed or dry?

AKP: Dehydrated onions have longer shelf life and a huge export potential. The Union ministry of food processing industries could incentivise investments in this particular sector for establishment of plants that make dry onions, onion chips or powder, etc. The urban, aspirational sections in India would be a good segment to catch up for such products.",0

797721,Why are Madhya Pradesh farmers throwing away their garlic crops?,"The production of the allium has doubled in the last decade; Chinese, Iranian garlic with larger cloves in greater demand, say farmers

Farmers need to invest a lot of money into producing garlic. However, the market rates right now are the fraction of their investment. Photo: Rakesh Kumar Malviya

There have been several calls to allow garlic export after several video clips on social media showed farmers from Madhya Pradesh throwing out or burning their crops, allegedly over low prices of the allium.

One clip making rounds showed the crop being dumped into a river, while another showed farmers pouring petrol on garlic and setting it on fire in Mandsaur, which has the state’s largest garlic market. Several incidents like these have been reported in Madhya Pradesh in the last few months.

The price of garlic is so low that farmers cannot even recover the money they invested in cultivation, Jagdish Patel told Down To Earth. The farmer from Rajoda village in Dewas cultivates wheat, onion and garlic.

This year, Patel grew garlic on three bighas of land or 0.6 acres. It cost him around Rs 30,000 per bigha of land, meaning he spent around Rs 90,000. Garlic crops require special additives and the fields need to be weeded and graded by hand, which drives up the cost.

Patel’s crop yield was around 4,750 kilogrammes. However, the current market rate for garlic is around Rs 100-150 for 50 kg. “Farmers can’t even recover the cost of tilling the land at these rates,” the farmer told DTE.

The harvest has been slightly low for the last three years but the prices are even lower. The harvest quantity would reach up to 45 quintals per acre earlier, Patel said. Usually, prices increase when the harvest is less.

The MP government had started the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, or price difference payment scheme, in 2017, the farmer said. The government pays farmers the difference between the official minimum support price (MSP) and the rate at which they sell their crops, whichever is higher.

Patel sold his crops under the scheme five years ago but is yet to receive the difference amount. “I am facing yearly losses and wonder whether it is worth farming garlic. But I do not have any choice,” he said.

A farmer in Sehore district’s Kharda village said he would not cultivate garlic and onions anymore. Ashok Parmar said he spent around Rs 45,000 this year on growing onions and garlic on two acres of land.

Parmar spent Rs 7,000 per quintal on garlic seed; however, the rate for the harvest is now Rs 400-500 per quintal. “I have incurred huge losses. There are no guarantees that farmers will receive the MSP either. My family will starve like this,” he said.

Mandsaur, Shajapur, Ujjain and Neemuch districts in the Malwa region of the state produce garlic. A government scheme called one district one product (ODOP) is also run in the state and Mandsaur district has been selected for garlic.

Garlic is also the most important crop in the region. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had issued directives to export garlic and sell it all over the country after a review meeting of the district two months ago.

Chouhan had also instructed that crops from Mandsaur be branded and modern garlic processing work be promoted.

The area producing garlic has more than doubled in the last 10 years. The crop was being grown on 94,945 hectares of land in 2011-12, which increased to 193,066 in 2020-21, according to the Economic Survey of Madhya Pradesh.

The production increased from 1.15 million metric tonnes to 1.98 million metric tonnes in the same period. However, the marketing for the allium crop is still aching even though the production has increased.

Garlic does not come under the minimum support price and there is no provision for it in the central government’s export policy either, said Ravindra Chaudhary of Yuva Kisan Sangathan. “The prices of garlic are up to the open market, so garlic farmers are in a lot of trouble,” said the member of the farmers’ body.

There is no demand for indigenous garlic in India anymore, Chaudhary claims. Garlic from China and Iraq is larger in size and is, therefore, in demand. The allium is being sold for Rs 70 per kg at supermarkets, the farmer activist also pointed out, even as farmers are dumping their crops. Garlic paste retails at Rs 25,000 per quintal, too, he said.

“The government needs to come up with the right policies to safeguard the interests of farmers,” Chaudhary said. Another market intervention scheme by the Centre provides aid to farmers if crop prices go down by 10 per cent or more if there has been a bumper harvest. However, garlic farming does not qualify for it.

“Garlic cloves are smaller this time, which is why the prices are so less,” said Sanjay Mittal, who trades garlic in Mandsaur Mandi. “Around 25-30 per cent of crops were damaged this year. Some crops are selling for Rs 100 per quintal while some can go for Rs 11,000, too,” the trader claimed.

There was a huge demand from Gujarat last year for garlic powder, which is not there this time. Overbuying last year may have led to less demand, said Mittal. “Garlic prices drop drastically every 4-5 years,” he said.

The operations at the Mandsaur Mandi is going smoothly, said Jagdish Singh Parmar, secretary of the market. “The mandi provides its selling arrangements and other facilities. We do not have control over the rate,” he said.",0
797771,"Wheat Crisis: Government procurement goals not met, food security risk increases","Wheat is being purchased at a higher rate than the MSP despite the export ban

The wheat crisis that started earlier this year, is on despite the Centre and states’ efforts, with governments not being able to procure wheat to improve food security. The Centre could procure 18.8 million tonnes (MT) of wheat till June 19, 2022. Punjab had the highest procurement of 9.64 MT, compared to the 13.22 MT that it procured last year. This is the lowest purchase in the past 10 years.

Haryana could only procure 4.2 MT of wheat, compared to 8.5 MT last. Uttar Pradesh recorded the least amount of wheat purchase. It purchased 0.33 MT of wheat this year, compared to 5.6 MT last year.

Madhya Pradesh procured 4.6 MT this year, comparedto 12.8 MT last year. Rajasthan procured just 9,000 tonnes of wheat this year, compared to 2.34 MT last year.

The drastic decline in the government purchase of wheat has been attributed to three main factors. First, traders purchased wheat from farmers at rates higher than the Minimum Support Price (MSP), due to the increase in global wheat prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Second, the intense heat in March and April this year has had an impact on wheat production. And third, the large revenues of the previous year caused a steady shift towards increased mustard cultivation this time, at the cost of wheat.

The UP government took several steps after the state procured low volumes of wheat. But none of them succeeded. The state government also instituted a mobile purchase procedure, informing farmers that officials would visit their villages to buy wheat if they so desired.

However, farmers did not express any interest. The UP government has once again postponed the deadline and will now procure wheat till June 30, 2022.

There is no clear information available about who is buying wheat in Uttar Pradesh. This is because local Arhtiyas (middlemen) contact farmers and offer them prices over the MSP. Moreover, payment is made as soon as the wheat is picked up, whereas a farmer is paid within five to ten days after selling the wheat at a government centre.

Bhartiya Kisan Union (Apolitical) spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said traders started buying wheat from farmers at a higher price after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the government banned all exports later.

Due to this, traders stopped buying from the farmers and the price fell below the MSP. Following this, traders started buying wheat again at a higher price, which eventually made farmers to stop selling their wheat to the government.

The administration is still unsure of the expected extent of the decline in wheat output. In February 2022, the government had released the second advance estimate, wherein the country’s production estimate was at 111.3 million tonnes.

However, just 5.6 percent of production was predicted to fall short in the advance estimate analysed in May, although experts predicted a production loss of 15-20 per cent. Malik added that the government needed to be open and honest about its production estimates.

On June 10, 2022, a statement came from the Union Ministry of Food and Public Distribution, initially admitted that despite all governmental efforts, the arrival of wheat for government procurement remained low.

However, the statement soon patted the government on the back, stating that wheat farmers across the country had benefited from higher market rates, as most farmers sold their produce to private traders at a higher market rate than the MSP. This, according to the government, is the main goal of its programme for farmers’ welfare.

The ministry stated, “It was discovered that farmers made more money selling their crop in the open market than they did under MSP this season, with an average selling price of Rs 2,150 per quintal.

“In a similar vein, on an anticipated 44.4 MT purchase, farmers would have made an average of roughly Rs 95,460 crore at Rs 2,150 per quintal, whereas the MSP would have made just Rs 89,466 crore at the cost of Rs 2,015 per quintal. Therefore, the wheat farmers would have earned a total of Rs 5,994 crore more than the MSP,” it added.

Food security, however, is at risk since government procurement has not been done. Initially, the government had planned to buy 44.4 MT of wheat during this Rabi season. But with farmers selling their wheat to merchants and the extreme heat in March, wheat production reduced.

As a result, the government changed its plan. The procurement target during the current marketing season was amended to 19.5 MT in the first week of May. Roughly 18.8 MT of wheat have been purchased so far, falling short of this objective as well.",0

Speaking at the launch event, Union Minister Mr. Tomar said that Fasal Bima Yojana aims to provide security cover to each farmer. He also announced thatthe scheme achieved milestone figure of Rs 95,000 crore of claims paid to farmers.

The Minister said that state governments and insurance companies have an important role in the implementation of PMFBY. The result of their hard work is that in the last 4 years, premium amounting to Rs 17 thousand crores was deposited by the farmers, against which more than Rs 95 thousand crores have been provided to them as claims. He further added that there is a need to expand the scheme in the country, so that its coverage can be increased and more farmers get benefits.

The Agriculture Minister also flagged off IEC vans which will continue to engage the farmers on the PMFBY throughout the crop insurance week. He also launched PMBFY e-brochure, FAQ booklet and a guidebook to assist farmers and on ground coordinators to understand the scheme, its benefits and the process of crop insurance.

Throughout the week, the campaign will cover all notified areas/districts under Kharif 2021 season, with special focus on 75 Aspirational/Tribal districts identified by MoA&FW where crop insurance penetration is low. From 1 July – 7 July 2021, multiple engagement activities will be conducted with farmers of these areas/districts through PMFBY vans, radio, regional newspapers, wall paintings, including digital media.

The on-ground and digital initiatives will explain the farmer about basics of the scheme such as how to enrol in the scheme with the NCIP portal, CSC centres, Insurance Companies, Banks, how to claim insurance under various circumstances, grievance redressal and reporting crop loss. Along with the farmers in tribal areas and aspirational districts, the campaign will engage women farmers as well.

Through videos and photo stories on social media, the campaign also aims to bring out stories of beneficiary farmers who have not only benefited from the scheme but helped the entire farming community through their thought-leadership.

Special care has been taken to ensure that COVID-19 protocols are to be followed wherever grass roots campaigns are being organized, especially during flag off ceremonies undertaken by several states.

The Minister urged all state governments and other stakeholders such as banks, CSCs, insurance companies to work together and reach out to the farmers in these identified 75 blocks/circles/tehsils. He also urged all the farmers to come forward and enjoy the benefits of crop insurance, become self-sufficient in times of crisis and support the creation of an Aatmanirbhar Kisan.

PMFBY was launched in 2016 under the leadership of PM Mr. Narendra Modi and his vision to provide financial security to the farmers of India from vagaries of nature and secure their hard work. Till date, the scheme has insured over 29.16 crore farmer applications (5.5 crore farmer applications on year-on-year basis). Over the period of 5 years, more than 8.3 crore farmer applications have benefited from the scheme. Moreover, Rs.95,000 crores claims have been paid as against Rs. 20,000 crore farmers share.

The virtual event was attended by Minister of State Mr. Parshottam Rupala, Mr. Kailash Chaoudhary and the Secretary, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare Mr. Sanjay Agarwal along with other senior officers of agriculture Ministry, Minister of Agriculture from the participating states along with other senior officers, insurance company officials and other stakeholders.",1
798755,Stopping subsidies will be fresh blow for India’s struggling small fishers: Experts,"Fisher community claims already vulnerable fishermen will not be able to access subsidises even if WTO negotiations turn in their favour

Removal of subsidies for fisheries across the world will put small Indian fishers at a greater disadvantage than the present situation, where they are forced into an unfair competition with bigger players within and outside the country, according to experts.

The fear surfaced as negotiations during the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva hinted at such an outcome.

Fisheries subsidies and the Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) Act are on the agenda of the conference that will conclude on June 16, 2022.

“The member of WTO wants to do away with the subsidies to make the trade freer for fishers across the planet but all the countries and their fishers are not at the same level,” said Pradip Chatterjee, convener of the National Platform for Small Scale Fisheries (NPSSF).

He added:

The major players, particularly the developed countries, pursuing industrial and commercial fishing have looted the oceans with large capacity equipment and over-fishing. The small fishers have suffered as they cannot compete with such giants.

It is the large-capacity fishers who are extracting marine resources at unprecedented levels, resulting in a faster rate of depletion of fish than replenishing them, said Chatterjee. “The trawlers, purse seines, gill netters and mechanised fishing boats are responsible for the environmental damages and not the small non-mechanised motorboats.”

The small fishers should be protected at all costs from such threats, he said. But representatives of the community claimed the Indian government is doing very little to protect the vulnerable.

“The Indian government in its Indian Fisheries Bill, 2021 has defined small and large fishermen alike. It is portrayed in the bill as if the entire country’s fisher population comprises small fishers. Which does not hold true,” he added.

The representative told Down To Earth:

Such a move will help large fishers in India access subsidies meant for the poor and vulnerable fishers. The large fishers will loot the major chunk of the marine resources, leaving little for the poor, and enjoy the benefits of the subsidies.

NPSSF has written to the Union Ministry of Commerce before MC12 began, urging the Centre to safeguard the interests of the small fishers.

“NPSSFW strongly holds that subsidies provided to the Small Scale Fisheries (SSF) are instrumental to protecting sustainable fishing, large employment, equitable distribution of income, food security and nutritional status of our society,” the organisation said in the letter.

With more than half the workforce being women, the small-scale fisheries sector has also to be supported for gender balance in employment, it added. “As such the provision of subsidies for SSF is non-negotiable.”

“We want the government to protect us from getting the subsidies removed but also, ensure that the interests of small fishers are protected in domestic waters,” Chatterjee added.

The National Fishworkers Forum, which represents nine coastal states and 15 trade unions, organised a Macchimar Sangharsh Yatra (Fishermen struggle march) on June 16 to highlight how the small fishers are getting affected.

“We are already getting displaced from the coastal areas as they are being eroded for port expansion and other development works, forcing us into deep waters,” said Olencio Simoes, general-secretary of the forum.

This is in addition to the hardships due to climate change, which is reducing fish catch and affecting the income, he added. “Moreover, the government is encouraging artificial fishing such as aquaculture and mariculture, which harm the wild capture fishers as they are deprived from the subsidies.”

The yatra started from Kerala and has reached Goa to create awareness among fisherfolk about the cause and encourage participation.

We are also drafting a coastal rights bill to protect the fishing community to table their right to fish, livelihood and land which will soon be submitted to the concerned departments of the government, Simoes said.",0
798785,Chhattisgarh farmers frustrated over black marketing of urea,"Farmers in the state are not getting urea; if they are, it is at almost double the price

Urea prices are skyrocketing in Chhattisgarh due to the government’s decisions these days. So bad is the situation that farmers are being forced to buy urea on the black market and then cultivate paddy at a higher cost and bear the losses. Due to this, farmers from Raipur, Mahasamund, Bilaspur and Gariaband districts have been rendered helpless.

Sushil Bhoi, a farmer from the Bagh Bahra area of Mahasamund district, said: “I went to Saraipali, thinking that a truck was going to bring urea and that I would get at least five to seven sacks. But I was in for disappointment when I reached the spot,” he told this reporter.

Bhoi said he and others complained to government agencies that farmers were having to purchase bags of urea in black at a price of more than Rs 600.

The administration also conducted raids, but nobody was caught due to the nexus between the authorities and others. “It is so bad now that no urea is available even on the black market,” Bhoi said.

Farmer leader Jugnoo Chandrakar said: “When we threatened to disrupt traffic, the Mahasamund collector sought a week’s time and assured that the situation will be back to normal soon.We have also tried to meet the chief minister in this regard. The agriculture minister has also given assurances to us. But there is still no change in the situation.”

Chandrakar said the condition of farmers not registered with cooperative societies was even worse. “In cooperative societies, farmers who are registered, can get a sack of urea for Rs 280-350. The rest have to buy urea from shops, where a sack can cost more than Rs 600,” he said.

Sohan Patel, a farmer from Basna, pointed out that farmers were willing to buy urea at a price slightly higher than rates fixed by cooperative societies, but were not getting urea at all.

Sudesh Tikam, a tribal farmer leader from Rajnandgaon, said the government’s policies and decisions were responsible for the plight of farmers.

“The government had ample opportunities to ensure that the first supply of chemical fertiliser could be made through cooperative societies. But 60 per cent of the urea was distributed to traders and now, traders are doing its black marketing. Who should be held responsible?” he said.

Tikam said the government wants to promote organic farming, but quality vermi-compost is not available in adequate quantity. At present, at least one trolley of vermi-compost will be required for an acre in comparison to two sacks of urea for the same.

More importantly, there is no market for organic farming products in Chhattisgarh, where farmers can get the right price for their produce.

Another important reason behind the black marketing of urea was its linking with Aadhaar cards, Chandrakar said. The linking of Aadhaar cards for availing urea and Diammonium Phosphate has been made mandatory across the country by the Narendra Modi government as the matter is related to subsidy.

But a drawback is that a person can buy as much urea as he wants on an Aadhaar card and the stock of urea is limited. This increases chances of black marketing.",0
798787,What is behind fertiliser shortage in Andhra Pradesh,"The crisis has forced farmers to buy from black market at exorbitent prices

Farmers in Andhra Pradesh, especially in areas which cultivate paddy and maize, complain of shortage of fertiliser, even as the state’s agriculture officials deny it.

Black marketing has made a bad situation worse and the hike in prices of fertilisers has become a double whammy, the farmers said.

A combination of measures brought in by the Centre in the name of transparency has added to the chaos, farm leaders mentioned. The shortage of urea, the most sought-after and subsidised fertiliser, is affecting the input costs of farmers the most.

They say the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBK), the state government’s centres at the panchayat level to distribute fertilisers, haven’t made much of a difference as they are also hit by a short supply of fertilisers from the Centre. During the launch of the facility, the state claimed the centres would sell fertilisers at a price Rs 10-25 less than the MRP cited by the companies.

The shortage is forcing them to buy from the black market, said T Bulli Raju, a farmer from Penakanamitta village of Kovuru mandal in East Godavari district. “We are not getting the fertilisers we need and are forced to even compromise on the brand and there by the quality.”

A combination of factors is causing the shortage, according to farm leaders. AP needs 1.6 million tonnes of fertilisers, of which 800,000 tonnes is urea, 300,000 tonnes is diammonium phosphate and the rest are other complex fertilisers.

“Companies making complex fertilisers have been using subsidised fertilisers of other companies as their raw material to make their products,” said S Malla Reddy, vice-president, All India Kisan Sabha. “Thereby, they enjoy double subsidy.”

He added:

Attempts to rein these companies are imperative as they are driven by their profit motive. Diversion of fertilisers meant for AP to other states is another reason for the shortage.

The Centre, while advocating reduced use of chemical fertilisers, has suggested a shift to organic farming for states. “If they want to rein in indiscriminate use of fertilisers in AP and Telangana, they need to test the soil and supply fertilisers accordingly to farmers,” he added.

Spreading organic manure on an acre of farmland costs the farmers Rs 5,000-6,000. Chemical fertilisers are much cheaper, they added. So, the transition cannot happen overnight unless there is an incentive for it.

The Centre, which provided a subsidy of Rs 1,28,761 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 1,40,703 in 2021-22, has reduced its subsidy on fertilisers to Rs 1,05,262 crore for the next financial year.

Attempts to rein in subsidy

Attempts to rein in this subsidy outgo by making Aadhaar-enabled authentication of fertiliser sale to farmers at the retailer level have added to the chaos, according to farmers.

The subsidies are credited to the accounts of the fertiliser companies only after the authentication by the farmers at the point of sale. Problems in connectivity sometimes forces them to sell without authenticating, fertiliser dealers said.

This results in a mismatch between the stock available with them and actual stocks there, making it difficult for retailers in placing further orders. To prevent this, companies send their representatives to dealers, along with those who volunteer, to authenticate these pending transactions.

They also said they are forced to buy products which are not in demand immediately when they seek stocks, and these are pushed on to farmers.

Companies mandated to transport the stock to the retailer within 150 kilometres from the stock point free of cost charge them, the dealers added. The additional money is taken in cash, they shared. This burden of this expense is passed on to the farmers.

The state’s Commissioner of Agriculture H Arun Kumar denied claims of shortage of fertilisers.

“We are forced to buy fertilisers like potash for nearly Rs 1,850 from private fertiliser dealers,” said C Mallikarjun from Tallacheruvu village, Acchampet taluk in Guntur district. “The maximum retail price of urea is Rs 267 and was also sold to us for Rs 420-430 per bag.”

The RBKs could not supply the needed fertilisers in time, he added. “Our capacity to repay money lenders has reduced. We cannot bear it any longer as input costs of pesticides and fertilisers have gone up.”

Finally, dealers aver the authentication system of distribution of fertilisers prevents them from sourcing products in areas with lower demand. This, they said, creates problems in allowing the market dynamics to play a balancing role in fulfilling the needs of farmers in a proactive manner.

Rates of fertilisers increased August-September of 2021.

798796,Union budget 2022-23: Big cut in fertilisers subsidy to worry farmers,"Urea subsidy cut 17%; allocation for NPK subsidy reduced 35%

Amid acute shortage of fertilisers in India, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman February 1, 2022, reduced subsidy on urea and nutrient-based (NPK) fertilisers. The move is expected to adversely hit the ailing farm sector.

The Rs 63,222.32 crore allocation for urea subsidy in her Budget for 2022-23 was 17 per cent lower than the revised estimates (RE) for 2021-22. Another Rs 42,000 crore was allocated to subsidise NPK fertilisers; that was 35 per cent below the RE.

The Centre has been reducing spending on fertiliser subsidies. The actual government spending on fertilisers in 2020-21 was Rs 127,921.74 crore. It was brought down to Rs 79,529.68 crore in the 2021-22 Union budget. This was revised to Rs 140,122.32 crore amid the farm crisis. In the current budget, it has been brought down by almost 25 per cent to Rs 105,222.32 crore.

The cuts come at a time when record fertilisers prices internationally have affceted regular supply of fertiliser products to Indian farmers. The Narendra Modi government has maintained that there is no shortage in the market, but an analysis of the Integrated Fertilizer Management System (iFMS) data from the Department of Fertilizer, Government of India for October 2021 shows a severe lack of fertiliser products, as per an article by the Economic and Political Weekly.

The country has reported several farmer protests over the shortage. Last October, farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Mahoba district had to delay sowing due to a fertiliser shortage. Five farmers in Bundelkhand region, which includes 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, also committed suicide due to the shortage. Fertiliser subsidy is a political issue in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections.",0
798797,Union Budget 2022-23: No mention of doubling farmers’ income in Sitharaman’s speech,"Omission of references to doubling farmers’ speech surprising given that 2022 is the target year for the scheme

There was no mention of the target of doubling farmer’s income (DFI) in either Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget speech February 1, 2022 or the budget documents. The omission is surprising as 2022 is the deadline for that target.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced February 28, 2016 that by the time India celebrated its 75th Independence Day in 2022, its farmers’ income would have doubled.

Last year, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said the budget of 2021-22 was aimed at achieving that target. The final budget before the deadline of the target could have been an opportunity for the Centre to outline its work under it and give an overview on the status quo.

Read DTE’s coverage on doubling farmers income

The target seems far away according to recent reports on farmers’ incomes.

The benchmark estimated annual income was Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 which was taken as a base year, according to the government’s DFI report. This comes to be Rs 8,059 per month, which was promised to be doubled in real terms, taking inflation into account by 2022.

“As such, the target income for doubling by 2022 is Rs 21,146 per month (taking inflation also into account),” a statement by Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture or ASHA, said.

However, the estimated monthly income of farm households in 2018-19 was Rs 10,218 per month in nominal terms, as the 77th round of Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households released in 2021 shows. It is nowhere near the target of Rs 21,146 per month.

“The budget was characterised by silence; earlier you had beautiful dialogues about farmers. This was the 6th year of doubling of farmers’ income. The previous five budgets had long poems about this target but now, when it was about accounting for those six years, there was silence,” said Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan.

Another crucial programme that was largely missing in its details was the government’s promotion of the organic farming scheme. Organic farming or natural farming has been listed by the government in the past as one of the activities to achieve DFI target. However, there was nothing much in the budget to that effect.

The only two points highlighted during Sitharaman’s speech in this connection were:

States will be encouraged to revise syllabi of agricultural universities to meet the needs of natural, zero-budget and organic farming, modern day agriculture, value addition and management.

Promotion of chemical-free natural farming throughout the country, with a focus on farmers’ lands in five-kilometre-wide corridors along the Ganga, in the first stage.

But there is no elaboration of this in the budget document. The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), which stresses on end-to-end support to organic farmers, has not got any allocation in this year’s budget, according to the budget document.

The only allocation towards organic farming in the budget is of Rs 198 crore towards its development in the North East region.

“The announcements related to organic and natural farming in the budget today are very small steps compared to the need of the hour and specifically after Prime minister’s appeal in December to make natural farming a mass movement,” Amit Khurana, director, Sustainable Food Systems Programme, Centre for Science and Environment, said.

Shweta Saini, who is a Senior Fellow with ICRIER and researches on Indian agricultural policies, said the government has been putting a thrust on zero budget natural farming but that thrust is not visible in the budget.

“Organic farming is diluted in the budget numbers. The document only speaks about its development in the North East region,” she said.",0
798819,"Crop insurance claims over Rs 3,300 crore pending due to payment failure, delay in state subsidy","Farmers belonging Jharkhand, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra have the highest amounts pending under insurance claims

Over Rs 3,300 crore is pending in payment to farmers across India in crop insurance claims since 2018-19 under the government’s flagship crop insurance scheme, due to ‘payment failure’ and delay in state subsidy.

An amount of Rs 3,372.72 crore out of claims worth Rs 66,460 crore in the last three years under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), was pending as on November 25, 2021.

This is according to a reply given by Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar in the Lok Sabha November 30. Of this, Rs 1,087.35 crore was pending for financial year 2020-2021.

Payment failure is one of the most cited reasons across states for non-payment of claims.

All admissible claims are transferred electronically to the bank account of the eligible insured farmers directly or the Aadhar Enabled Payment System.

The reply stated:

However, payment failures occur due to errors in banking details essential for money transfer such as mismatch in name in bank accounts, IFSC Code, account number, dormant bank account and death of eligible insured farmer without nomination, etc, in transfer of claims amount.

The PMFBY was launched in 2016. The government appoints an insurance company, selected through bidding, to insure farmers in a cluster of districts against crop losses due to weather events, pest attacks, or fire as part of the scheme.

The insurer charges the premium on an actuarial rate (an estimate of the expected value of future loss). Farmers under PMFBY pay a fixed two per cent of the sum insured for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for Rabi and oilseed crops and 5 per cent for commercial / horticultural crops.

The balance is shared by the central and state governments on a 50:50 basis and 90:10 in case of northeastern states.

Farmers belonging Jharkhand, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra had the highest amounts pending under insurance claims, according to the reply.

The amount of reported claims also saw a huge dip in 2020-21, signalling that the scheme is not finding favour with farmers despite increasing crop damage, especially due to heavy rain.

In 2020-21, the ‘provisional’ amount of reported claims has reduced to Rs 9,725.24 crore, from Rs 27,394 crore in 2019-20.

The admissible claims under the PMFBY are generally paid by the concerned insurance companies within two months of completion of ‘Crop Cutting Experiments’ / harvesting period.

They are paid within one month of notification for invoking the risks / perils of prevented sowing, mid-season adversity and post-harvest losses subject to receipt of total share of premium subsidy from concerned government within time.

“However, settlement of a few claims in some states got delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data, late release of their share in premium subsidy, yield-related disputes between insurance companies and states, among others,” the government said in another reply to a similar question on crop insurance payment.

‘State subsidy pending’ was the second major reason for non-payment of insurance. The agriculture minister said that some states have not released their share of premium subsidies for certain seasons; however, any specific reasons for such default have not been communicated.

States have not been regular in paying their share of premium over the last few years, citing heavy financial load.

The government, in a separate question on state subsidy in crop insurance payment, stated that the pending state subsidy amounts to Rs 4,744 crore for financial years 2018-2021.

This is more than the amount of the total claims pending. This mismatch in figures was not explained.",0
798833,"Green fodder shortage hits milk production in Bihar, farmers affected","Unable to feed them, farmers resort to distress sale of cattle

Milk production has decreased in Bihar due to shortage of green fodder for milch cattles following excessive rainfall and repeated floods during monsoon this year. This has badly affected cattle farmers.

Sanjay Kumar, deputy director, Bihar Dairy Development Directorate, several farmers had to sell off their milch cattles.

Shortage of green fodders forced hundreds of farmers to sell their cattle in flood-affected Supaul, Katihar, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Vaishali, Begusarai and Samastipur districts.

Mahesh Mandal, a cattle farmer from Darbhanga, said repeated floods damaged the kharif crop too: “We lost green fodder, a staple diet for milch cattles. We cultivated it again after water receded, but it will take a month for it to be ready for harvest.”

He added that with early floods after surplus rainfall in mid-June, farmers used available dry fodder in their storage and green fodder to feed cattle. All was washed or destroyed by floods.

Another cattle farmer, Suraj Yadav of Supaul, said the situation compelled them to resort to distress sale of cattle or purchase high cost dry fodder from the market.

Most fodder and cattle feed went to waste in floods, which have led to the death of 43 people and affected 3 million across 2,104 villages. With cattle already under stress, standing in floodwaters, their yield has gone down. Cows, which used to give 12 litres of milk, now give an average of six litres a day.

Both Mandal and Yadav said increase in dry fodder price also affected them. Till early this year, dry fodder rate cost Rs 500-600 per quintal, which later increased to Rs 900-1,000 a quintal.

Mandal said rising price of diesel also contributed to rise of dry fodder rate: “The government has failed to help cattle farmers of flood-affected districts by not providing dry cattle feed at subsidy rate.”

Milk production decreased 30-40 per cent due to shortage of green fodder in the state, according to officials of the Bihar State Milk Co-Operative Federation Ltd (COMFED).

COMFED’s average daily fresh milk procurement has come down to 8-10 lakh litres from 17-18 lakh litres last year.

Milk production was hit by COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. Daily milk procurement was nearly 17 lakh litres in 2020; it was more than 18 lakh litres in 2018-19, said COMFED officials.

COMFED is reportedly purchasing milk from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Rajasthan to bridge its demand-supply gap.

Bihar received only three per cent surplus rainfall till September 30 following the arrival of the monsoon on time. This is less than last year’s, when the state received 25 per cent surplus rainfall from June-September.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal from July-August. But Bihar received surplus rainfall in June this year, just as the monsoon arrived. This resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.",0
798840,Bihar to give subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate crops due to waterlogging,"It has approved Rs 550 crore for farmers whose standing crop was damaged this monsoon season

The Bihar government has announced compensation for farmers who could not even sow this Kharif season as large tracts of agricultural land remained under water due to excessive monsoon rainfall. The general practice has been to compensate only those who lose standing crops due to bad weather — floods, droughts, etc.

The Bihar cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar October 11, 2021 approved Rs 550 crore for farmers whose standing crop was damaged this monsoon season. It has also, in a first, earmarked Rs 100 crore in farm subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate on their land due to waterlogging.

Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary in the Cabinet, said the decision to provide agriculture input subsidy to farmers for their standing crop damage is not new; that it will give farm subsidy to all farmers who could not cultivate on their land is.

“The subsidy will be given on the basis of ground assessment carried out by the district officials concerned,” Kumar said.

Harendra Yadav, a marginal farmer from Muzaffarpur district, said: “For the first time the government has decided to take care of farmers like me who could not use their farmland for cultivation. It is a big relief.”

Yadav is one of thousands of farmers affected by waterlogging since mid-June.

The government decision will help farmers, mainly the small and marginal ones, said RK Sohane, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor, Bihar Agriculture University, Bhagalpur.

“This will help small and marginal farmers to invest in Rabi crops,” he added.

He added the government agencies can easily identify farmers who could not use their land for cultivation due to waterlogging by using remote sensing data. Besides, the kisan salahkar (farmer advisor) at panchayat level will help the government prepare a list of affected farmers.

The standing crop was damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year, according to agriculture department’s assessment.

Repeated floods and surplus rains damaged standing crop across thousands of hectares as farmland were submerged for weeks.",1
798898,Incoming corporate wave in food systems will threaten farmers and consumers: Report,"This will trigger massive shift of rural dwellers to urban areas, exacerbate land and resource grabs by corporations

An incoming ‘corporate tidal wave’ in the food industry as well as farming may threaten the interests of millions of farmers and consumers alike, a recent report has cautioned. This may trigger a massive shift of rural dwellers to urban areas, exacerbate land and resource grabs by corporations and make supply chains more susceptible to pandemics and climate change.

The report, released March 30, 2021, analysed ‘business-as-usual’ food systems and how it may evolve over the next quarter century (by 2045) as corporations and governments respond to environmental breakdown, social dislocation, geopolitical reconfiguration and a vast pipeline of technological possibilities.

The scenario will mean handing the keys of the food system over to big data, technology and e-commerce platforms, which may exacerbate food insecurity and further environmental degradation, the report said.

The report was released by International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES) and ETC group (Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration).

The study warned of specific threats to farming and food security if agribusiness plans come to fruition:

Artificial intelligence is re-engineering ecosystems, and robotic tractors and drones are being rolled out as fast as digital infrastructures allow. Millions of rural dwellers will be forced to migrate to urban areas.

Data on food is a valuable strategic asset. Peasants, whose land acquires a new value now that it is more readily accessible to robotic farm equipment, are vulnerable to fresh land grabs. The report cautioned that a new wave of land, ocean and resource grabs is imminent.

Powerful corporations and major governments are now moving to control food supplies across vast economic corridors. Long, complex global supply chains will be more vulnerable to pandemics, climate change and critical ‘chokepoints’.

‘Hyper-nudging’ is on the rise. This means data from everyday transactions (digital wallets to automated food services) is getting increasingly combined with information harvested online to manipulate people’s eating habits.

“The keys of the food system are being handed over to data platforms, private equity firms, and e-commerce giants. This is the dystopian future of food and the planet, unless civil society fights back,” warned Pat Mooney, lead author of the study.

The authors stressed on the ‘Long Food Movement’ for the next 25 years — a series of strategies that could boost post-COVID-19 pandemic resilience, slash agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions by 75 per cent, and shift $4 trillion from the industrial food chain to food sovereignty and agroecology.

The report added: “This includes $720 billion in subsidies going to big commodity production, and as much as $1.6 trillion in healthcare savings from a crackdown on junk food. The sum total of these actions could cut 75 per cent of food system emissions.”

Some of the key strategies include:

Diverting funds from major commodity subsidies, research expenditures and ‘niche’ budget lines to small-scale food producers.

Supporting short supply chains and territorial markets: By 2045, as much as 50 per cent of food would be sourced from local and regional supply chains. Up to 80 per cent of wealthier populations can go flexitarian.

Levying taxes on junk food, toxins, carbon dioxide emissions and the revenues of multinationals.

Adopting emergency food security measures that supersede trade and intellectual property rules.

Ensuring that famine, malnutrition and environmental degradation are considered criminal violations that can be internationally prosecuted.

798956,"Government programmes to increase yield, better seeds will aid production of pulses","The demand for pulses by 2030 will be 32.64 million tonnes

There is no verified report that the country’s farmers are ceasing pulse cultivation. The production of pulses has increased through the years, from 8-15 million tonnes till 2006-07 to 16 million tonnes in 2015-16, 23.13 million tonnes in 2016-17, 25.23 million tonnes in 2017-18 and eventually, 25.58 million tonnes in 2020-21, due to the concerted efforts of research institutions and policy.

With this rise in output, pulses’ imports dipped from their highest at 6.6 million tonnes in 2016-17 to 2.5 million tonnes in 2018-19. In 2019-20, India imported 2.6 million tonnes and is expected to import 2.5 million tonnes this year.

However, domestic production is still unable to cater to the country’s needs, as it is far from the exponential growth in population. The demand for pulses by 2030 will be 32.64 million tonnes, with an annual required growth rate of 2.64 per cent. Also, almost 80 per cent of area under pulses is rainfed.

That said, there are a number of strategies we can follow to increase domestic production of pulses: First, we must raise their productivity to 1,000 kilograms per hectare (ha). It is already on the rise, from around 690 kg per ha in 2010-11 to 809 kg per ha in 2019-20.

Next, though there are time-tested high-yielding pulse varieties available, their seeds have not reached the farmers as expected, despite government-run programmes to do so. A special drive in this regard will help. Farmers should also be educated on the use of fertilisers and plant protection measures.

Farmers can also be given special incentives to grow pulses in place of rice or wheat, as in states like Punjab. There is a vast area of rice fallow land in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal, with potential for pulse cultivation.

Similarly, the existing area under rice, millets, barley, mustard and wheat can be diversified to include pulses. Intercrop cultivation of short-duration pulse crops with long-duration ones like sugarcane, red gram, cotton, maize, sorghum, will help. Finally, research can play a great role by studying biotechnology of pulse cultivation.

798989,How balanced soil nutrient management can save Indian agriculture,"The ill-effects of imbalanced application of fertilisers — which leads to soil sickness, decline in soil health and reduces crop productivity — need to be understood

Soil is rightfully called the ‘soul of infinite life’. This soul, however, has become dilapidated of late due to ill-agricultural practices being adapted to feed the ever-increasing mouths.

The Green Revolution of 1965-66 helped India, for the first time since Independence, gain self-sufficiency in food production. This was achieved through adaptation of modern technologies such as high-yielding varieties (HYV) of rice and wheat, tractors, pesticides, irrigation facilities and fertilisers.

Fertiliser consumption was less than a million tonnes before the mid-1960s, but it grew with the introduction of HYV seeds. It reached 12.73 million tonnes in 1991-92 as against 0.78 million tonnes in 1965-66.

For Indian agriculture and politics, it was indeed a happy time, but over the years, the grey side of the Green Revolution has cropped up, mostly in the form of deteriorating soil health.

Small and marginal farmers of Punjab and Haryana still associate fertilisers with urea. They can also be heard saying “SSP, DAP, MOP (Single Super Phosphate, Diammonium Phosphate, Muriate of Potash)” in hushed tones. Farmers’ knowledge about fertilisers is limited.

For the last few years, at the end of every Kharif and Rabi season, some news channels boast of a bumper crop. But if that is the case, why is our country still leading in malnutrition? Why is the farming community not getting a profitable output to input ratio?

The chief reason behind this is imbalanced nutrient management or over attention towards nitrogen (urea) from our policy makers and farmers. Imbalanced nutrient management refers to not applying the right kind of fertilizer or not applying the right amount of it at the right time.

Fertilisers account for the most expensive inputs in Indian agriculture, but are not understood as much.

Farmers and policy makers should first comprehend the ill-effects of imbalanced application of fertilisers, which leads to soil mining or soil sickness, decline in soil health, reduces crop productivity, crop water and nutrient use efficiencies, deteriorates environmental and human health and leaves a dent in the farmer’s pocket.

Over the years, undue focus on nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (N, P, K) nutrients has led to upcoming secondary (sulphur) and micronutrient (zinc, boron, manganese) deficiencies in soils of different parts of the country, and sooner or later, the farming community as well as the country would have to pay the price.

Our best bet is to increase our crop productivity, sustainability and crop nutrient and water use efficiencies. Farmers and policy makers should understand that we must feed the crop according to its needs.

Balanced nutrient management works on the 4R concept: The right fertiliser, right rate of usage, right time and right place of application. The aim is to shift focus on micronutrients that are sometimes more important than primary nutrients.

Through its aim of feeding the crop and not the soil, balanced nutrient management considers nutrient reserve of the soil, nutrient removal by crop, targeted yield, the economics of fertilisers and profitability, farmers’ investment ability, agro-techniques, soil moisture regime, soil physical environment and adverse soil conditions such as salinity, alkalinity and acidity.

The concept is based on site specific nutrient management and not an umbrella recommendation. Balanced nutrient management works in the direction of building soil health, maintaining ecological balance, increasing crop response to fertiliser application and majorly crop productivity and restoring the skewed N:P:K ratio of the soil.

Nature magazine in 2018 published a ground-breaking 10-year study by China Agriculture University around millions of smallholder farmers adopting enhanced practices.

Through a scaled, countrywide effort, farm productivity rose by 11 per cent while the use of nitrogen fertilisers — critical to increasing crop productivity, but also harmful to the environment when overused — declined by 14-18 per cent.

The profitability of the intervention, even before monetising the positive environmental impacts, was $12.2 billion. In our country, a major setback to balanced nutrient management approach could be attributed to the decontrol and price escalation of chemical fertilizers, a non-renewable source of energy.

A subsidy on urea and limited knowledge to our farming community about advantageous effects of balanced nutrient management on their pockets and standard of living would also help.

The domestic consumption of urea grew moderately at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.3 per cent from 31.9 million tonnes in financial year 2016-17 to 33.6 million tonnes in FY 2019-20.

The demand for urea remains stable because of the traditionally high usage and also the fact that the freeing up of retail prices for non-urea fertilisers, following the implementation of nutrient-based subsidy (NBS), has led to a significant price differential of urea vis-à-vis non-urea fertilisers.

It appears that in the present scenario, farmers as well as policy makers need an education regarding balanced nutrition in Indian agriculture. They need to understand that crop does not only need N, P or K, but other nutrients as well such as Zinc and Boron.

During the current scenario of India’s soil health in terms of nutrient imbalance, physical, chemical and biological deterioration, we cannot run faster towards adapting a balanced nutrient management approach. The ugly face of malnutrition and farmer suicides in India has shone light over our wrong approach towards agriculture practices.

No matter where we reach, India will always depend upon its own farming community and limited land resources to feed its population. Balanced nutrient management for our soils and crop productivity, therefore, needs to be promoted and adapted at all levels.

We cannot and should not wait for another major setback to bring us back on track. We should be aware about the needs of our soils, crops and our farmers’ household and adapt the best possible balanced nutrient management approach to save Indian agriculture.

798992,The future of Indian agriculture,"There is a need for work on cost-effective technologies with environmental protection and on conserving our natural resources

Agriculture in India is livelihood for a majority of the population and can never be underestimated.

Although its contribution in the gross domestic product (GDP) has reduced to less than 20 per cent and contribution of other sectors increased at a faster rate, agricultural production has grown. This has made us self-sufficient and taken us from being a begging bowl for food after independence to a net exporter of agriculture and allied products.

Total foodgrain production in the country is estimated to be a record 291.95 million tonnes, according to the second advance estimates for 2019-20. This is news to be happy about but as per the estimates of Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), demand for foodgrain would increase to 345 million tonnes by 2030.

Increasing population, increasing average income and globalisation effects in India will increase demand for quantity, quality and nutritious food, and variety of food. Therefore, pressure on decreasing available cultivable land to produce more quantity, variety and quality of food will keep on increasing.

India is blessed with large arable land with 15 agro-climatic zones as defined by ICAR, having almost all types of weather conditions, soil types and capable of growing a variety of crops. India is the top producer of milk, spices, pulses, tea, cashew and jute, and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables, sugarcane and cotton.

In spite of all these facts, the average productivity of many crops in India is quite low. The country’s population in the next decade is expected to become the largest in the world and providing food for them will be a very prime issue. Farmers are still not able to earn respectable earnings.

Even after over seven decades of planning since the independence, majority of the farmers are still facing problems of poor production and/or poor returns. Major constraints in Indian agriculture are:

According to 2010-11 Agriculture Census, the total number of operational holdings was 138.35 million with average size of 1.15 hectares (ha). Of the total holdings, 85 per cent are in marginal and small farm categories of less than 2 ha (GOI, 2014). Farming for subsistence which makes scale of economy in question with majority of small holdings. Low-access of credit and prominent role of unorganised creditors affecting decisions of farmers in purchasing of inputs and selling of outputs Less use of technology, mechanisation and poor productivity for which first two points are of major concern Very less value addition as compared to developed countries and negligible primary-level processing at farmers level. Poor infrastructure for farming making more dependence on weather, marketing and supply chain suitable for high value crops.

Future of agriculture is a very important question for the planners and all other stakeholders. Government and other organisations are trying to address the key challenges of agriculture in India, including small holdings of farmers, primary and secondary processing, supply chain, infrastructure supporting the efficient use of resources and marketing, reducing intermediaries in the market. There is a need for work on cost-effective technologies with environmental protection and on conserving our natural resources.

The reforms towards privatisation, liberalisation and globalisation affected inputs market at a faster pace. Agricultural marketing reforms after 2003 made changes in marketing of agricultural outputs by permitting private investment in developing markets, contract farming and futures trading, etc. These amendments in marketing acts have brought about some changes but the rate is less.

Along with this, the information technology revolution in India, new technologies in agriculture, private investments especially on research and development, government efforts to rejuvenate the cooperative movement to address the problems of small holdings and small produce etc are changing face of agriculture in India.

Many startups in agriculture by highly educated young ones show that they are able to understand the high potential of putting money and efforts in this sector. Cumulative effects of technology over the next decade will change the face of agriculture.

All the constraints in agriculture make the productivity and returns complex but still a high untapped potential is there in India’s agriculture sector.

Advantageous weather and soil conditions, high demand for food, untapped opportunities, various fiscal incentives given by the government for inputs, production infrastructure, availability of cheap credit facilities and for marketing and export promotion are attracting many individuals, big companies, startups and entrepreneurial ventures to do a lot of investments on innovations, inventions, research and development and on other aspects of business.

The efforts are being done to convert all the challenges in agriculture into opportunities and this process is the future of agriculture.

Key trends expected

1. Changing demand due to increase in incomes, globalisation and health consciousness is affecting and going to affect more the production in future. Demand for fruits and vegetables, dairy products, fish and meat is going to increase in future.

2. Researches, technology improvements, protected cultivation of high value greens and other vegetables will be more. There will be more demand of processed and affordable quality products.

3. More competition will be there among private companies giving innovative products, better seeds, fertilisers, plant protection chemicals, customised farm machinery and feed for animals etc in cost effective ways at competitive prices giving more returns on investment by farmers. Use of biotechnology and breeding will be very important in developing eco-friendly and disease resistant, climate resilient, more nutritious and tastier crop varieties.

4. Some technologies will be frequently and widely used in future and some will become common in a short time while some will take time to mature. For producing the same products in other way so as to use resources judiciously and using new resources also like hydroponics, use of plastics and bio-plastics in production. There will be more of vertical and urban farming and there will also be efforts in long term to find new areas for production like barren deserts and seawater.

5. Precision farming with soil testing-based decisions, automation using artificial intelligence will be focused for precise application inputs in agriculture. Sensors and drones will be used for precision, quality, environment in cost effective manner.

Small and marginal farmers will also be using these technologies with the help of private players, government or farmer producer organisations (FPO). Use of GPS technology, drones, robots etc controlled by smart phones etc can make life of farmers easy and exciting with good results. These advanced devices will make agriculture be more profitable, easy and environmentally friendly.

6. Use nano-technology for enhancement of food quality and safety, efficient use of inputs will be in near future. Nano-materials in agriculture will reduce the wastage in use of chemicals, minimise nutrient losses in fertilisation and will be used to increase yield through pest and nutrient management. IFFCO has already done successful tests in nano-fertilisers.

7. India has improved remarkably in its digital connectivity and market access has become very easy. The number of internet users is projected to reach 666.4 million in 2025. Farmers will be behaving more smartly with mobiles in hands and would be able to be more aware and connected with different stake holders. Government will be making wide use of digital technology for generating awareness among farmers, information sharing, government schemes using digital technology for direct transfers of money.

8. There will certainly be more work by government, village communities, agri startups and private players in conserving sharply depleting water resource. Use of digital technology can make revolution in this direction. There will be use of satellites, IoT, drones for better collection of data regarding soil health, crop area and yield which will make cost for insurers less with better estimations and system will be more exact and effective.

9. There will be more of niche marketers in operations, area, and crop specific small equipments which will make operations even at small farms easier and efficient.

Food wastage will be less and better use of waste materials in agriculture will be more. Number of warehouses in private sector will be more and linkages between government and private warehouses will be increasing. This will help in balancing supply with demand and stabilisation of prices of agri-outputs in the market.

10. Retailing in agriculture will largely be digitalised. A study estimates that over 90 per cent of kirana stores across the country will be digitalised by 2025 with modern traceable logistics and transparent supply chain. Many players have already taking kiranastores to the door steps of consumers like Amazon and Jio Mart.

Question arises whether farmers will be able to make use of modern technologies in a country where education, holding size, infrastructure, low level of technology adoption and many other constraints are there.

799428,Sugar production likely to increase by 12% Y-o-Y in SY2021: ICRA,"Share this

23 July 2020, New Delhi: The domestic sugar production is likely to increase to 30.5 million MT, by 12.1% Y-o-Y, in SY2021, after adjusting for the impact of the diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for ethanol manufacture. ICRA expects the closing stocks for SY2020 at around 11.0 – 11.5 million MT after considering the consumption of 25 million MT (decline of 3.8% Y-o-Y) and exports of 5-5.5 million MT.

Read: Basmati rice companies set to rise 100-150 basis points

This along with higher sugar production for SY2021 is likely to result in domestic sugar availability of around 42 million MT. In the light of the continuing sugar surplus scenario in the domestic market, continued government support would be critical for industry’s profitability.

Says Mr. Sabyasachi Majumdar, Senior Vice President & Group Head, ICRA Ratings, “This increase in production is majorly driven by the increase in cane availability in Maharashtra and Karnataka in SY2021. The domestic sugar consumption was adversely impacted by the nationwide lockdown owing to covid-19 pandemic due to loss of demand on account either closure or limited operations of several beverage/food manufacturing units during April-May 2020.

With the easing of lockdown rules, the consumption is back to pre-covid levels in June-July 2020. While we expect a decline in the sugar consumption in SY2020, the same is likely to go back to 26 million MT levels in SY2021.

The closing stocks are expected at around 10.5-11.0 million MT for the SY2021 season, which is higher when compared to the normative sugar stock levels.”

Higher Production in Maharashtra and Karnataka

The production is likely to increase in SY2021 because of higher production in Maharashtra and Karnataka in SY2021, which was adversely impacted in the previous year due to drought. In addition, heavy rainfall and water logging during the last year (August – September 2019) adversely impacted the cane crop in a few regions of Maharashtra and North Karnataka for SY2020.

Without considering the impact of the diversion of B-heavy molasses and sugarcane juice for ethanol manufacture in SY2021, the production is expected to be around 32.0 million MT. In Maharashtra, production is expected to increase by 64% Y-o-Y at 10.1 million MT and in Karnataka, by 26% Y-o-Y to around 4.3 million MT in SY2021.

Uttar Pradesh production is likely to decline by 3% Y-o-Y to 12.3 million MT. In SY2020, the production was higher by around 0.5-0.6 million MT than anticipated because of the cane which was generally used by the local gur and khandsari manufacturers, got diverted to sugar mills with the former’s operations prematurely shut due to the lockdown.

Export of about 5-5.5 million MT expected

While the exports were on lower side during lockdown period given the modest port operations owing to the logistics issues and labour shortage, the pace picked up in May-Jun 2020. ICRA expects exports of around 5-5.5 million MT for SY2020. Assuming the Government continues support for exports for SY2021, considering the surplus scenario in the domestic market, exports are likely to be similar to the SY2020 figures.

The sugar prices moderated closer to MSP levels of Rs. 31/kg in March – May 2020 during lockdown period and then picked up to Rs. 32-32.5/kg in June 2020. The pick-up in consumption and pace of sugar exports is likely to support the sugar prices in the near term. However, given the sugar surplus scenario, any significant increase in the sugar prices is ruled out.

“The continued government support for sugar industry remains critical for supporting the profitability of the sugar companies going forward given the continuing sugar surplus scenario. The Government support in the form of subsidies for sugar exports, creation of buffer stock and continued support with MSP for sugar would be critical going forward.

Also, the support for the ethanol manufacture in the form of price support to ethanol, especially those manufactured from B molasses and sugarcane juice and the interest subvention of loans for augmentation of distillery capacities is likely to support the industry during times of over-supply”, Mr. Majumdar added.

796645,"Maharashtra doubles input subsidy for farmers, citing extreme weather events","Maharashtra farmers skeptical about doubling of input subsidy by state government; say benefits hardly accrue to them

The Maharashtra government announced an increase in input subsidy costs for the upcoming sowing season in a notification September 14, 2022. The decision aims to bring relief to farmers affected by extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, floods, cyclones and other natural calamities.

The input subsidy for rain-fed agriculture has been increased to Rs 13,600 per hectare from Rs 6,800 per hectare. The financial assistance for irrigated land has been raised to Rs 27,000 from Rs 13,500.

The assistance offered to farmers taking crops throughout the year via canal or other perennial irrigation systems has been increased to Rs 36,000 from Rs 18,000. All financial help for the scheme is limited to two hectares.

The notification mentioned that the heavy rains in July affected farmers. Moreover, districts like Latur, Osmanabad and Beed in the Marathwada region experienced snail infestation during the ongoing kharif season.

On July 11 and 12, incessant rains lashed Maharashtra, affecting 800,000 hectares of land across 24 districts of the Marathwada region. The rains, measuring 326 millimetres according to India Meteorological Department data, damaged crops like banana, tur, corn, cotton, soyabean, paddy and other vegetables.

The government notification stated that farmers applying for the input subsidy will be verified with inspection and necessary help will be provided accordingly. The state government has allocated a fund of Rs 98.58 crore for the cause.

The central government has also categorised the pest attack as natural calamity. The beneficiaries will be shortlisted and the monetary amount will be deposited directly in their bank account.

However, farmers are skeptical about the announcements and are taking it with a pinch of salt.

Kailash Tawar, district president of the Shetkari Sanghatna, a farmers’ union in Maharashtra told Down To Earth: “The state government has announced many farmer-oriented schemes recently. But none have accrued to actually benefit them.”

Tawar said Chief Minister Eknath Shinde recently announced the release of about Rs 900 crore for the construction of irrigation canal in Paithan, about 30 km from Aurangabad. But he did not speak about the planned investment while addressing a gathering September 14.

Tawar said the scheme was initiated in 2015 by the Devendra Fadnavis government, but farmers were skeptical as to whether it would actually help improve their lives. “It is also important that the inspections are done fairly and the financial assistance is received on time before the sowing for the rabi season begins,” he added.",1
796701,Pressure from banks pushes farmers to commit suicide',"One year since the Maharashtra farmer protests, Down To Earth speaks to Raghunath Dada Patil on the deepening crisis

Raghunath Dada Patil, a Maharashtra-based farmer leader and national president of ‘Shetkari Sanghthan’, talks to Down To Earth on the one-year anniversary of Maharashtra farmer protests long march from Nasik to Mumbai. Former member of the NITI Ayog expert committee on agriculture, he speaks on the under-value farm loans and the recent cases against farmers in Punjab for defaulting on loans

Maharashtra has witnessed a series of farmers protests. In February 2018, the protests caught the attention of the national media when around 50,000 farmers walked from Nashik to Mumbai. Do you think indebtedness of farmers in Maharashtra is going to be an issue in the upcoming parliamentary election? Also, do you think the recent farm loan waivers in Maharashtra helped indebted farmers?

Farmer protests in Maharashtra are highest among all Indian states. It’s the government policies which push the farmers into a debt trap and consequently to commit suicide. The number of farmer suicides have increased during the Narendra Modi government.

The loan waiving scheme turned out to be another phase of harassment for farmers as it did not help them. As per the scheme, one needs to pay back the debt already undertaken minus Rs 1.5 lakh. If a farmer has of debt Rs 5 lakh, as per government scheme, one farmer needs to pay back debt of Rs 3.5 lakh to the bank to settle complete debt.

After three years of BJP rule in Maharashtra, the state government came out with a loan waiving scheme of Rs 1.5 lakh per farmer. This scheme was like a one-time settlement of debt to avail waiver of Rs 1.5 lakh.

If I had Rs 3 lakh why would I be living like this? We don’t have that amount of money, so we don’t get the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver. Another problem is that those who have got their loan waived once won’t get the waiver for the second time.

We asked for loan waivers as we didn’t get the right price for our produce. Now, they have declared it in their election manifesto that if they get elected again, they will give 50 per cent profit on cost of production.

Narendra Modi started his tenure as Prime Minister with this issue, yet the issue is not solved. If he had solved this issue, it would not be an issue in this election again.

The other declaration of providing Rs 2,000 income support to farmers won’t help them either. In a five-member family, what will a person do with just Rs 2,000? I spend Rs 2,000 on just a tractor… It won’t give us any relief.

With the animal slaughter ban, animal rearing became difficult; we can’t even sell the animal later.

There should be a permanent solution, there’s no proper water and electricity supply still people are ready to do handwork. But we still don’t get the real price for our produce.

Till the 1960s, when I was a kid, the population was 40 crores, and agricultural produce was imported from from Australia, Canada, USA, Russia etc. Wheat and rice were the main produce. Back then, we did not have the capacity to feed the population, so we imported from outside.

Today the population is 130 crores, but we produce enough to feed the entire population. There is no scarcity of food, rather the production is so high that there is no place to preserve the surplus.

Who produces this? Tata or Birla? No. Farmers are producing that amount of food, we made the country self-sufficient, but all we got was poison. The government is doing all this because they want us to leave our villages, become cheap labour for the corporate sector, cheap domestic helps for their homes.

Tenant farmers are always at the receiving end. They do not get any benefit of any scheme like loan waivers or income support. How do you think the problems of sharecroppers or tenant farmers can be solved?

It doesn’t matter, whether it is the tenant farmer or sharecroppers or labourers. They must pay rents, which is usually fixed. Don’t divide farmers on that basis and just give them their profit, they can manage it afterwards. Abolish the export ban, if they accepted a free economy, then why put a minimum export price on onion.

A long-term policy of transparency is needed. In sugar industry, C. Rangarajan-led committee suggested an end to the export ban, yet it is not implemented even after 10 years.

You have said there is huge disparity in loan sanctioned and real value of agricultural land. The loan sanctioned to a farmer is much less than value of land. How do you see this disparity?

A stark difference is there, we don’t get even one per cent of the land price. If the cost is Rs 1 lakh, we get only Rs 1,000. Now, it has been increased to Rs 10-15 lakh for one acre; in Punjab it is Rs 20-25 lakh for an acre. But, they provide a maximum of Rs 2-4 lakh on crops, if there is any water project or tractor, they give us Rs 5-10 lakh. When the land cost is up to Rs 1 crore, they give us Rs 10 lakh.

They don’t give us the real price. We have a demand that they give us 80 per cent loan on e-stamp duty and Ready Reckoner (a guide published annually by state governments, which determine the rate of properties in a particular area, on which stamp duty and registration charges are levied).

Just like they give 80 per cent loan on gold, they should give us 80 per cent loan on Ready Reckoner rates. But we don’t get that.

Q: In above context, don’t you think farmers may end up losing their land or are you indirectly saying that farmers should give up farming after taking value of land?

To collect stamp duty, they set the price of our land at Rs 5 lakh per acre based on cropping in 1 acre. If they us 80 per cent loan on the value of land, no one will have to commit suicide.

The current financial plans are not enough for farmers. If you give me Rs 2 lakh to build a well, but the actual price for constructing it is Rs 3 lakh, then the Rs 2 lakh didn’t really help.

Why will a farmer leave his land? Land price increase with time so he/she will not leave. Now with the system of Gunthewari (measuring land by Guntha as a unit), 40 Gunthe is equal to 1 acre; but it is banned to purchase land below 10 Gunthe. Now if I want to sell 2 Gunthe of land for some reason — marriage, medical emergency —I can’t sell that.

Q: How can farmers handle the pressure from banks in case of default?

See, because of this pressure, farmers commit suicide. There are three reports on this — first by Sharad Joshi which said that there is no subsidy for farmers in this country but only negative subsidy.

Second report by the Tata Institute for Social Science has clearly stated that Krishi Lagat Aivam Mulya Aayog (1955) is responsible for farmer suicides. The price they give is too less. The third report, or the MS Swaminathan report, states that to stop farmer suicides they should be given 50 per cent of the production cost.

Despite these reports, the government has not adopted these recommendations. The export ban should end if onion price rises above Rs 30, otherwise they should put export ban on every crop so we can get a good market value.

The Essential Commodity Act (1955) should be abolished. An industrialist gets subsidy whenever he exports his production. That is the export incentive. But they ban the same in the case of farmers.

Q: What is the way out for farmers from this land crisis? What kind of protective or preventive measures should be taken?

Nothing more needed from the government if they can abolish the Acts that prevail since the British era. If we get good price for our production, we will pay our debts, nothing else is needed.

Q: Reports by Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) show farmers never get the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Don’t you think there should be a mechanism like to provide assured income like in the case of Telangana and Odisha?

Nobody gets the MSP that’s why farmers commit suicide. Yes, Rs 12,000 won’t help us. These schemes are only for two years, after that they won’t give us anything. Until we get the cost of production, these small things won’t help us. When farmers are given money, prices of other things go up, like petrol, diesel and seeds. The money flows out easily.

796706,Indian farmers can take on the multinationals,"Sharad Joshi, the well-known, controversial farm leader from Maharashtra, outlines a new strategy for agriculture.

AT A RALLY of 300,000 people in Shegaon, Maharashtra, last November, the Shetkari Sanghatana put forward a new farm programme called chaturang sheti (four-pronged agriculture). Sanghatana leader Sharad Joshi argued the economic crises and the collapse of statist development models have resulted in the state being unable to extract surpluses for industrial development at the expense of agriculture. Welcoming liberalisation as a lifting of government restrictions, Joshi insists farmers can face competition in the world market. Chaturang sheti ranges from farming for export to Sita sheti (Sita farming), which envisions women farming small plots for household consumption.

Doesn't the programme you gave for Sita sheti at Shegaon sound suspiciously like natural farming?

Why do you use the term ""suspiciously""? If the two are similar, that is a happy thing. However, any suspicions are that the two programmes, Sita sheti and organic farming, are only superficially similar. It is a fact that people all over Maharashtra and India are working for organic agriculture. We are happy about this, but there are important differences between organic agriculture and Sita farming.



While both agree that a shift away from the Green Revolution (GR) package is desirable, there is a difference in emphasis. We are neither champions nor antagonists of the GR package. In fact, we are apologists for it in the sense that we believe that in the 1960s there was no alternative. Without it there would have been massive starvation. But that period is over and we have attained some sort of food self-sufficiency.



Now, the question is: In what direction do we move? Many are talking today of replicating Punjab's Green Revolution in the eastern region, but we feel we must innovate and discover a new technology and package.



What is ""Sita farming""?

It is essentially an open-door research programme, which is entrusted to women. GR was brought in through labs supported by the government. The approach we took is that the work will be done by women, who are most interested.



We want women to experiment on their own small plots and exchange information among themselves about the rational way of production. Our approach would not necessarily be organic. There will be an investigation of all kinds of products and practices for the improvement of the produce. I think, ultimately, we'll have to evolve a rational scientific mixture of the various categories of inputs.



Why is Sita farming particularly for women?

In the search for an alternative package, a basic change in paradigm is involved and I have a feeling that most men have somehow been brainwashed into full involvement with either chemical or organic agriculture. For women, the new role will bring in a degree of confidence.



Sita has been the traditional name for the goddess, as daughter of the earth, and in the Ramayana there are many references to Sita's role. Her life, her fate, her misery, her tragedy have all become a central motif of the rural women's movement led by Shetkari Mahila Aghadi.





There has been a spontaneous evolution of idiom rather than any calculation. We found that the reaction that men and women gave to the travails of Sita was a force in itself. We are not like Marxists who don't touch anything that comes from tradition. If it's called ""Lenin sheti"", would it be good?



Why is Shetkari Sanghatana taking up this issue just now?

In the collapse of the Nehruvian model, we've achieved the goal we set ourselves a decade earlier. Agriculture is on the threshold of being recognised as a vocation, rather than a lifestyle. We've accomplished a lot in 10 years, not only with regard to remunerative prices, but also in women's rights and organic farming.



Would you say that the extreme centralisation of capital accumulation in the process of capitalism and colonialism is mainly responsible for environmental destruction?

I have one rider. There are imbalances within the Third World countries also. A number of people who claim to be champions of the Third World today are really champions of the ""Indias"" within the Third World. There is no homogeneity of interest even with regard to the environment here.



But why are all these new developments in the farmers' movement and environment movement taking place now?

The historic world defeat of a system that was supposed to be the only alternative to capitalism is one factor. The economic crunch faced by the Third World neo-colonial states is another. It is understandable that the long-subjugated, real producers try to take up some programmes like the Shegaon one. Environmentalists are largely disillusioned socialists in search of an argument that would justify statist intervention, now that Marxist economics has failed.



Possibly, something more fundamental is happening below the surface.

I am talking of those who are trying to move backwards to the old agriculture and those who are trying to mobilise farmer support against the Dunkel draft by creating imaginary phantoms. They know little of agriculture and less of agricultural developments.



Aren't these stirrings among peasants in many countries in the world, in many ways, a basis?

You are out to find similarities that don't exist. And, you are out to find differences. Well, let's talk of other aspects of chaturang sheti.



Why is processing (mazghar sheti) important and is it also connected with women?

At the present stage, yes. Agroprocessing is a very important part of the alternative pattern. While export and commerce of value-added agricultural produce is important, the Alfa-Laval method of value-adding is proving to be very expensive for the farmer as the entire benefit goes to the technology vendor and the subsidy dispenser. Therefore, we have thought of a different pattern of agroprocessing, where the product is not of western style, but of Indian origin. There, we feel nobody can compete with us. And, we do that with our own technology, respecting, of course, standards of hygiene.



But aren't multinationals in the agricultural sector trying to limit the farmer to cultivating the crop? Won't you have to fight the multinationals?

I have to fight with them, but fight with them economically. And, I'm very confident that the Indian farmer with his mazghar sheti can countenance all the competition from the multinationals. There are certain areas we can't compete in and there are certain areas they can't compete in. But we would like to one day get to the position where they are today.



What gives you this confidence?

India's position should be not to introduce artificial restrictions, but to create a situation where the introduction of subsidies and restrictions on the lines of the European Economic Community would become less and less practicable. We have to be advocating more free marketing because it's in our interests. We can sell wheat right now at Rs 300 when nobody in the world can sell it for less than Rs 600. That's the advantage we have.



Many feel it is wrong to talk of exporting food when so many are undernourished in India.

We've had undernourishment because exports are banned. If we had that kind of market availability, production would have spurted. Exports have not caused malnourishment. It's the other way around.



Do you want to remain only primary producers?

I think there are regions on the earth that are more conducive to production of biomass and there are regions that are less so. It would be wrong for a country in the tropics to produce something that is more appropriate, say, to the Scandinavian countries. You ask if some countries are always to remain primary producers? Yes, as long as the terms of trade allow biomass producers to live with the same dignity and with the same standard of living as industrial producers.



Why do you talk of vyapari sheti or commercial agriculture?

It's not commercial agriculture, it's normal agriculture. What we are proposing right now is something that is very common in all industrial societies, chain store networks and retail outlets, all of which are totally absent here. We are proposing a structure that combines farmers and consumers.



So, while almost all environmentalists and left organisations have condemned the New Economic Policy, you welcome it.

Yes. Those who can compete if trade barriers, subsidies and production restrictions are dropped, will welcome liberalisation. The Indian industrial system cannot survive without subsidies; the Bharat farmer can. Therefore, we welcome liberalisation. We only ask that the government not limit liberalisation to industry but extend it to agriculture also, so that farmers are allowed full rights to produce, to process and to sell without restriction. We also ask that the government use all its strength in favour of abolition of subsidies and lowering of trade barriers that are used at present to shore up US and European inefficiencies. As the Dunkel Draft includes primarily a programme for a phased dropping of restrictions and subsidies, we support it. We are not afraid of patents. We will patent our own seeds and crop varieties that farmers have developed over the centuries. Farmers can face the challenge of the multinationals, only if our own government does not come in the way.",1
796726,"‘Govt is cheating us, destroying traditional agriculture’","Farmers living in tribal areas in Jharkhand alleged that industrialists and the government are conspiring to ruin diverse traditional seeds and crops

Farmers from Jharkhand’s Singhbhum district, a tribal area, alleged that the government and industrialists are trying to destroy their traditional knowledge of agriculture and looting cultivable land.

This happened on the last day of a conference held on ‘Traditional agriculture: challenges and possibilities’ at Chaibasa this month. These farmers belonged to Gangaram Kalundia Forum, named after a leader who was murdered in 1982 while fighting for the villagers’ fundamental rights against displacement.

“Much-acclaimed increase in agricultural production during green revolution was the result of proper irrigation facilities and an increase in agricultural land. On the other hand, dams built in the name of irrigation have actually been built for the benefit of the corporate houses,” read a declaration released by the farmers.

They further alleged that the Centre’s and the state government’s “propaganda” about farmers adopting advanced seeds by introducing high-yielding and hybrid seeds is to destroy their “rich treasure of diverse traditional seeds and crops”.

According to the declaration, “Millions of seeds, which were the basis of our food sovereignty and biodiversity, are lost forever. By stripping farmers of lands in the name of alleged development and depriving us of our food sovereignty and corresponding nutritional security, our constitutionally protected right to life is under attack.”

The farmers have demanded that gram sabhas be allowed to develop and promote traditional agriculture, knowledge on integrated farming be spread, traditional seeds be conserved, traditional farming practices be given preferences and village societies be given control over forests under the Forest Rights Act 2006.

They also want the government to reject amendments to Jharkhand's tenancy laws like Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act, and to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 to ensure no acquisition of cultivable land.",0
40,India aims to end urea imports from 2025; pegs FY23 fertilisers subsidy at $27.2 billion,"India aims to end imports of urea from 2025 as the nation boosts its local production capacity with the commissioning of new plants, fertilizers minister Mansukh Mandaviya said on Wednesday. India, the top importer of urea, imports about 30% of its average 35 million tonnes of annual consumption of the crop nutrient. We are aiming for ending our dependence on imported urea by 2025... our five new plants will be commissioned by then,"" Mansukh Mandaviya told reporters.

Plants at Gorakhpur in northern state of Uttar Pradesh, Ramagundam in southern Telangana, and at Talcher, Barauni and Sindri in eastern India, would together produce 6.5 million tonnes of urea every year.

Production of indigenous local urea containing nanoparticles of the crop nutrient, also known as nano urea, would rise to 5 million tonnes by 2025, he said, adding Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate the Ramagundam plant on Nov. 12.
India now imports urea from a number of countries, including Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates.

Asia's third largest economy needs crop nutrients to feed its huge agriculture sector which employs about 60% of the country's workforce and accounts for 15% of nearly $3 trillion economy.

Mandaviya said due to higher global prices India's fertiliser subsidy bill for the fiscal year to March 31, 2023, would rise to a record 2.25 trillion Indian rupees ($27.21 billion) from previous year's about 1.5 trillion rupees.
Urea accounts for about 70% of India's overall fertiliser subsidy.

The government also provides a fixed amount of financial support to companies for selling other fertilisers at lower rates to help farmers.

On Wednesday, India approved the second tranche of 518.75 billion rupee subsidy for phosphatic and potassic fertilisers for the second half of this fiscal year.

42,"PM to launch urea bags under 'Bharat' brand, release 12th tranche of PM-KISAN funds on Oct 17","Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch subsidised urea bags under a single brand 'Bharat' as part of the 'One Nation, One Fertiliser' scheme and inaugurate 600 PM Kisan Samruddhi Kendras at a two-day event starting October 17 in the national capital.At the event to be held at Mela ground in Pusa complex, Modi will also electronically transfer Rs 16,000 crores to the bank accounts of over 8.5 crore farmers as part of the PM-KISAN scheme, aimed at providing direct support of Rs 6,000 annually to them.

The PM will also unveil an international weekly fertiliser e-magazine called 'Indian Edge' and inaugurate an agri-startup conclave and exhibition at the event 'PM Kisan Samman Sammelan 2022' organised jointly by Agriculture and Fertilser Ministries.

Briefing reporters, Agriculture Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said in a biggest move in fertiliser sector, all subsidised soil nutrients -- urea, Di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), Muriate of Potash (MoP) and NPK -- will be marketed under a single brand 'Bharat' across the nation.

The PM will be launching 'Bharat urea bags' during the event, he said and added the government is making it mandatory for companies to market subsidised fertilisers under 'Bharat' brand.

This is being done as part of the 'One Nation, One Fertiliser' (ONOF) scheme of the Fertiliser and Chemicals Ministry with an aim to prevent criss-cross movement of fertilisers and reduce high frieght subsidy, he added.


During the event, the PM will also inaugurate 600 PM Kisan Samruddhi Kendras (PM-KSK) that will act as a one-stop-shop providing multiple services to the farmers.
At present, fertiliser retail shops in the country are company managed, cooperative shops or retailed to private dealers. These retail shops will now be converted into PM-KSK.
Tomar said the government plans to convert at least one retail shop at each district level to a model shop. The plan to is covert 3,30,449 retail fertiliser shops into PM-KSK.

On the occasion, Tomar said, the PM will also release 12th installment amount of Rs 16,000 crore to over 8.5 crore farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme of the agriculture ministry.

With this, the total amount transferred to the beneficiaries is expected to cross well over Rs 2.16 crore, he said.
Under the PM-KISAN, launched in February 2019, eligible farmers are provided a benefit of Rs 6,000 per year in three equal instalments of Rs 2,000 each, every four months.
Further, the PM will also inaugurate the 'Agri Startup Conclave and Exhibition' during the event, in which 1,500 agri-startups are expected to participate and hold technical sessions.
About 300 startups will showcase their innovation related to precision farming, post-harvest and value addition solutions, mechanisation for small farmers, agri-logistics on the first day.
The platform would facilitate startups to interact with farmers, farmer producer organisations, agri experts and corporates.

The agriculture ministry is promoting startups providing seed funds under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana-Renumeration Approaches for Agricutlure and Allied Sector Rejuvenation (RKVY-RAFTAAR). Over 2,500 startups have been trained under this so far.

he Union Cabinet has approved nutrient-based subsidy (NBS) rates for Phosphatic and Potassic fertilisers for the Kharif season (from April 1, 2022, to September 30, 2022).

Briefing media about the Cabinet decision, Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur said the Cabinet has approved a subsidy of Rs 60,939 crore on P&K fertilisers for the Kharif season against the subsidy of around Rs 57,150 crore on these nutrients for the entire last fiscal.
He said the subsidy on DAP (di-ammonium phosphate) has been increased to Rs 2,501 per bag and the farmers will continue to get the DAP at Rs 1,350 per bag.

Thakur said the subsidy on DAP has been increased to 2,501 per bag from 512 per bag in 2020-21.

The minister highlighted that even as the prices of fertilisers have increased sharply in the global markets, the government has ensured that the burden has not increased for the farmers.

The Nutrient Based Subsidy (NBS) Scheme is being implemented since April 2010.

Under the NBS Policy, a fixed rate of subsidy (in Rs per Kg basis) is announced on nutrients namely Nitrogen (N), Phosphate (P), Potash (K) and Sulphur (S) by the government on annual basis.

The per Kg subsidy rates on the nutrients N, P, K, and S are converted into per tonne subsidy on the various P&K fertilisers covered under the NBS Policy.

The government is making available fertilisers, namely urea and 24 grades of P&K fertilisers to farmers at subsidised prices through manufacturers/importers.

In the case of urea, the Centre fixes the maximum retail prices and reimburses the difference between the MRP and production cost in form of a subsidy.

796932,Govt allows 6mn-tonne sugar export,"Share this

07 November 2022, New Delhi: India on Saturday allowed 6 million tonnes of sugar to be exported during 2022-23, a move aimed at restricting unlimited overseas shipments and ensuring domestic availability.

The Union government has put various curbs on sugar shipments, despite robust output, mainly to check rising inflation and channel more cane towards domestic ethanol production, but the export quota for the new sugar season was more or less in line with market forecasts, analysts said.

Amending the export policy for sugar season beginning November 1, the directorate general of foreign trade (DGFT) in a notification to mills stated that the government has “decided to allocate sugar mill wise export quota of 60 lakh million tonne (6 million tonne) of sugar for export for sugar season 2022-23, with effect from November 1, 2022”.

The limits on exportable quantity comes amid the Union government’s efforts to rapidly scale up its ethanol-blending programme. Mixing of petrol with ethanol, which is made from molasses, a by-product of sugar, will help lessen the amount of oil India imports

The country has advanced the target year for 20% ethanol-blending by five years to 2025. Ethanol is made from molasses, a sugar by-product.

The notification setting the export quota stated that “all grades of sugar like raw material along with refined sugar can be exported by a sugar mill, refinery, exporter up to the notified limit”.

Sugar mills unwilling to sell overseas can exchange their export quota either partially or wholly with the domestic quota of any other sugar mill within 60 days from the date of issuance of Saturday’s order.

This will cut transportation costs and ease movement of the sweetener from one state to another, the government said.

796992,"Stubble Burning: Central Govt. Refuses to Give Cash Incentive to Farmers, Says Bhagwant Mann","Bhagwant Mann said that the government is arranging equipment on a large scale for the remaining 38 lakh acres and that this season, more than one lakh crop residue management machines will be made available for controlling stubble.

On Saturday, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann told media that the Central government has reportedly turned down the Punjab government's proposal of contributing to the cash incentive to farmers for not burning stubble.

This development follows the Punjab government's proposal to pay paddy farmers Rs.2,500 per acre. According to a report from PTI, the government had proposed that the Centre pay 1,500 per acre while Punjab and Delhi governments would be responsible for paying Rs.1,000 per acre.

It is important to note that the paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana is one of the reasons behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November as farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. Additionally, Punjab also produces over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw each year.

In a video message on Saturday, the chief minister of Punjab stated, ""We had written to the Centre that it should help us with the issue of stubble burning. But the Centre rejected our demand.""

However, the chief minister of Punjab said it does not matter. If the central government is not supporting then it does not mean we will not do anything.

Bhagwant Mann also informed that he has asked his officers to come up with a different solution to address the issue. Mann shared some information about stubble burning and noted that 75 lakh acres of paddy are sown. He further said that farmers manage stubble across a 37 lakh acre area using machinery for crop residue management or other methods.

Mann said that the government is arranging equipment on a large scale for the remaining 38 lakh acres and that this season, more than one lakh crop residue management machines will be made available for controlling stubble.

It must be noted that the Centre gives funds for the provision of subsidized machines for the management of crop residue, as per the report, under the in-situ management (mixing crop residue in soil) of the paddy stubble scheme.",0

797033,PM Kisan Latest Update: 1 Lakh Farmers May Not Get 12th Installment,"All PM Kisan farmers must check beneficiary status as well as list to confirm if they will get the next installment of Rs. 2000 or not.

If you are a beneficiary of PM Kisan scheme and waiting for the next installment then we have an important update for you. Officials of the agriculture department said that as many as 1 lakh farmers may be deprived of financial assistance this time.

The agriculture department of Andhra Pradesh informed that around 1 lakh beneficiaries in Prakasam district may not get Rs. 2000 under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana this time as they have not completed their eKYC. It is important to mention that the government had made eKYC compulsory for all the farmers.

Further, the agriculture department said that there are almost 3.18 lakh farmers in Prakasam district. Though all of them have completed their Aadhaar authentication process or the registration process for PM Kisan, only 2.2 lakh have finished the eKYC process as well.

Officials told the Centre has extended the deadline to complete the eKYC process four times still only 68% of the farmers have completed it till September 15.

Previously, the Centre had declared 31 July as the deadline, but after request from the State government as well as farmers’ associations, the last date to complete eKYC was extended three times & finalised to 18 September.

Agriculture Joint Director (JD-A), A Srinivasa Rao said now we have no information if the deadline for completing eKYC will be further extended.

Also, there are reports that out of the abovementioned 1 lakh farmers in the district who will not receive financial aid, around 35,000 could be ineligible as they might be paying Income Tax or have more than 1 beneficiary in the family, or have submitted the wrong documents. The remaining 65,000 are eligible, but their details are not known.

Reports further said that these farmers have not been living at their registered residential addresses and their mobile phone numbers are also not reachable.

796711,"Rains fall short: Major losses ahead, fear Bengal paddy farmers","Heavy rain for rest of monsoon might complete the deficit, says IMD, but will that be enough?

Kharif crops in West Bengal have been severely affected due to insufficient rain this monsoon season. Farmers in the state, especially in south Bengal, heavy losses as Aman paddy cultivation has been hit by rainfall deficit.

West Bengal has a deficit of 39 per cent, while south Bengal has a deficit of 47 per cent.

“Farmers have not been able to even sow the seeds due to the lack of rain,” said Anil Gope, a paddy farmer from Burdwan district.

Gope has 10 bighas of agricultural land. “There is no irrigation system here, so farming is completely dependent on rainwater,” he said. “If the rainfall becomes normal by August 15, I still have a chance to harvest crops. Else I will face huge losses.” A bigha of land is around 0.62 acres.

The farmer invests around Rs 60,000 on his farm every year. He will lose earnings for the entire year if there is no rain, as post-monsoon potato and mustard crops would also be affected.

Monsoon had a late start in the region this year, around June 18, which is a delay of 10 days, said GK Das, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Kolkata. This year, the monsoon is estimated to officially withdraw from Bengal on October 10.

“The overall deficiency is primarily caused by two reasons: Late onset of monsoon and no low-pressure area near Bangladesh or Bay of Bengal to bring more rain to West Bengal,” he said.

Low pressures in these areas lead to heavy to mid-level rain in south Bengal. A low-pressure area was created near the Andhra coast; therefore, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had enough rain in July, for example.

Monsoon 2022 is expected to be normal for Bengal, Das said. “However, two to three good depressions or low-pressure systems are needed for a normal monsoon,” he said.

There may be some heavy or continuous rains in the remaining days of July and all of August, September and the beginning of October, the weatherman added.

“As we are facing extreme weather events due to climate change. Continuous or heavy rainfall can help recover from the deficiency,” Das said

Major paddy-growing districts like Howrah, Hoogly, Nadia and Burdwan are already lagging in sowing this season compared to previous years.

“So far, I have not invested in Aman harvesting at all,” said Tosalia Dhabek from Nadia district’s Hanshkhali.

Dhabek has 10 bighas of agricultural land, and he usually harvests paddy on around half of it, investing around Rs 25,000.

“There is no rain and irrigation systems aren’t working as well in the absence of enough rain. Even if it rains at August-end, paddy farming is possible,” the farmer said.

“Then it will be mustard in September-October and again paddy in February,” Dhabek said. No Aman harvest will mean a huge setback for him.

Farmer Kartik Mandal from Hoogly district’s Khanakul has sown paddy seeds on three bighas of land, hoping for better rain. He has two acres where he also plants potatoes and almonds.

“I have to spend Rs 105 per litre of kerosene to run a water pump for my farm. On sowing days, the pump runs for four hours a day. This is impossible for small-scale farmers,” he said. Good rain for the rest of the monsoon will give him a chance to recover his money.

Mandal is a member of a cooperative society which gives him a loan of Rs 30,000 for Aman harvesting. He has sown 15 kilograms of paddy seeds, priced at Rs 105 per kg.

The farmer had already faced losses in his almond harvest earlier this year due to continuous rain at the end of April. Last year, he sold Rs 2,47,000 worth of almonds but didn’t even get a lakh rupees this time.

Another farmer complained that seeds are drying up due to lack of rain. “I have already sowed 22 kgs of paddy seeds on my six bighas. It will all be ruined if there is no rain. How will I survive,” asked Manotosh Dolui from Howrah district’s Amta.

Dolui has sown seeds priced 60 per kg in his low-lying land and seeds priced 72 per kg on the high ground. He usually invests Rs 40,000-50,000 for a return of around Rs 60,000-70,000, barely enough to sustain his family.

“Even irrigation systems need some good rain,” he said.

Like Mandal, Dolui also faced losses in his mustard and almond nuts.

However, he lost his crops to a lack of rain after March. “I only got 8-10 kgs of harvest per katha of land, instead of the usual 30-32 kgs,” he said. A katha is equal to 0.0165 acres of land.

796742,"Deficient rainfall in Bihar, paddy farmers fear drought, crop loss","Most of Bihar’s 38 districts are facing rainfall deficit, according to IMD’s data

Paddy farmers in Bihar fear a drought and loss of their crops after the state recorded a large deficit in rainfall in the crucial first half of July.

Some 80-85 per cent of paddy farmers in Bihar have prepared seedlings (known locally as dhan bichra), according to Bihar’s agriculture secretary N Sarvana Kumar. Most farmers have prepared paddy seedlings on their small patches farmland.

But the transplantation of paddy seedlings has been done in only 0.67 million hectares (mha) of the total target of 3.52 mha. “If rainfall had been normal, nearly 40 per cent of paddy seedlings should have been transplanted so far,” an official told this reporter.

The transplantation of paddy seedlings is as low as five per cent in 15 districts and 10 per cent in 17 districts, according to the department. The transplantation of paddy seedlings was completed on 1.36 mha of 3.3 mha till July 16. In 2020, it was done on 1.76 mha of 3.3 mha.

Sanjay Kumar, an official at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Centre, Patna, said July 15, 2022, that Bihar recorded 194.6 millimetres (mm) of rainfall from June 1 to July 15.

This was 42 per cent less than the normal 335.6 mm of rainfall. The state has received only 22.4 mm rainfall from July 1-15, which is 87 per cent less than the normal 172.4 mm.

Most of Bihar’s 38 districts are facing rainfall deficit, according to IMD’s data. The deficit in Araria, Purnea, Madhepura, Bhagalpur, Buxar and Supaul is nearly 97 per cent to 95 per cent.

The deficit in other districts is 90 to above 60 per cent, except Kaimur, where deficient rainfall is 32 per cent, the lowest in the state.

Hundreds of thousands of farmers across Bihar are facing a difficult situation due to the rainfall deficit.

Praying for rain

Pramod Singh and Lakhan Prasad, both marginal farmers of Karpi block in Arwal district, fear a drought as there has virtually been no rain in the last 15 days in July.

“Our farmland and paddy seedlings are ready for transplantation. But we are yet to start transplantation due to lack of water and rainfall deficit,” Singh, a resident of Katesar village, said.

“We farmers are waiting for rain even during the month of Sawan (Shravana) to start the much-awaited paddy seedlings transplantation. If the long dry spell continues for one more week, a drought is certain,” Prasad, a resident of Kinjar village, said.

Even big and well-off landowners, who managed to complete paddy transplantation by using diesel pump sets and electric-run motors, are worried about the rainfall situation.

“We have used a diesel pump set to avail water and complete paddy seedlings transplantation. But we are not sure how long they will survive without rain,” Shivnath Pandey, a farmer of Kutumba block in Aurangabad district, said.

It is not easy to pull out ground water daily as water evaporates from farmland due to the hot and humid climate, Pandey added.

“There is no water in the canal because the water resources department has failed to discharge water for irrigation purposes despite no rainfall,” Dhananjay Kumar, a farmer of Bala Bigha under Haspura block in Aurangabad, said.

Aurangabad has recorded a deficit of 85 per cent. So far, nearly one per cent of paddy seedling transplantation has been completed in the district.

Aurangabad district agriculture officer Ranveer Kr Singh said he had appealed to all farmers to save their paddy seedlings and keep them alive for transplantation as rainfall was expected next week.

Khagaria district agriculture officer Shailesh Kumar said paddy seedlings transplantation was badly hit by poor monsoon.

Dinkar Prasad, Katihar district agriculture officer, said nearly 32 per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted so far. The transplantation process was getting delayed due to deficient rainfall, he added.

Nearly 25 per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted till date in Supaul, Kirshi Vigyan Kendra’s scientist Manoj Kumar, said.

In several districts including Jamui, Nawada and Banka, farmers have been struggling to keep their paddy seedlings green as they turn yellow due to lack of water.

“My farmland is dry. Even the nursery of paddy seedlings has developed cracks because of no rain since the last two weeks. Am doing everything to save them. But this is a challenge as temperatures are hovering at 35-37°C,” Musafir Mahto, a marginal farmer of Sinhauli village in Nawada, said.

Mahto said hardly one per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted in his area.

N Sarvana Kumar said this past week that so far, only 15-20 per cent of the transplantation of paddy seedlings had been completed. The agriculture department has targeted 3.52 million hectares for paddy cultivation this year.

The state’s agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh said the government was aware of the situation and asked district officers to provide help to farmers by ensuring supply of power and other measures.

Bihar’s farmers are heavily dependent on monsoon rain for kharif crops, mainly paddy, a water-intensive crop.

In the last 13 years, monsoon rainfall has been above normal five times in June. In 2021, Bihar received 111 per cent surplus rainfall, 82 per cent in 2020, 37 per cent in 2011, 5 per cent in 2013 and 6 per cent in 2022.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal during July and August. But surplus rainfall in June resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.",0
798745,Dry to deluge: Incessant rain a threat to Marathwada farmers,"After scanty rainfall in June & early July, Maharashtra region now has a problem of too much downpour in too short a span

Large parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha have been severely affected by the incessant rain

Incessant rain in Marathwada, which was going dry not so long ago, has turned a threat to farmers.

Rain in the last 15 days has damaged about 100,000 acres of agricultural land in Maharashtra, according to officials. Vidarbha region has also reported major losses.

The state received over 35 per cent more rainfall in July, recording 459 mm against the expected rain of 340 mm. Several districts reported rainfall 200 per cent above average.

The weather conditions are likely to persist through July 16.

A farmer from Kurunda village in Marathwada said the erratic rains had destroyed 15 acres of crops. “I lost my soybean and turmeric plots overnight due to the unceasing rains on July 12,” lamented Ashok Dalvi.

Dalvi had been eagerly waiting for the monsoons for respite but has now lost all hopes of a successful harvest. He had spent Rs 70,000 on sowing and fertilisers. “The excessive rains have washed my investment down the drain,” he told Down to Earth.

Farmers said their crops had been destroyed by the deluge

About 55 per cent of Marathwada region and around 40 per cent of Vidarbha has been severely affected by the rain, said Dheeraj Kumar, state agriculture commissioner. Around 100,000 acres of agricultural land has been destroyed, he said.

Kumar said Aurangabad district has received 206 per cent more rainfall in July already, with 132 mm rainfall against the 68 mm average.

The official record from the divisional commissioners showed that rain in Hingoli district deviated by 303 per cent, recording 353 mm rain against an expected 116.

Kalamnuri taluka saw 431 per cent excess rain, while Basmat saw 274 per cent more rainfall. Aundha and Sengaon talukas also received 285.5 per cent and 268.2 per cent excess rain, respectively.

The scenarios in other districts were similar. Drought-affected Latur received 66.8 mm of rain in 24 hours, Osmanabad had 42.5 mm.

Nanded district received an average of 123mm rainfall over a 24-hour period, officials had reported on July 13.

The head of the Kurunda village, Rajesh Patil, said that 20,000 farmers in Hingoli district are facing a fate similar to Dalvi.

“The entire village is affected because of the incessant rains,” said Patil. “The agricultural land is submerged, plots and cattle have been washed away and there is no guarantee that resowing will lead to a harvest.”

The rain over the last fortnight has affected 70 per cent of agriculture production in Marathwada, said Jayajirao Suryawanshi, a farmer activist.

“Incessant rainfall in various pockets has damaged crops like tur dal and cotton. Meanwhile, several parts of the region have not received rain. These farmers are also staring at heavy losses,” he said.

Suryawanshi claimed that several suicides by farmers had also been reported.

Official figures from the divisional commissionerate showed that as many as 306 cases of farmer suicides had been confirmed in Aurangabad for June.

The erratic rains have made farming a hazardous profession, Suryawanshi told DTE.

“Marathwada did not receive much rain in June and early July. But the rain intensity increased in the last few days and covered the deficit. But rains like these can lead to crop damage instead of being beneficial,” he said.

He said that farmers would be in an even trickier situation if rains pause entirely for the next 15 days of the month.

Areas that received more than 90mm of rainfall within 24 hours can be categorised as having received excessive rainfall, said Uday Deolankar, former agriculture advisor with the state government.

“However, the areas that have received it traditionally receive more rain,” Deolankar added.

The cause of excess rain

An increase in the severity of east-moving easterly winds and west-moving winds, or westerlies, have caused high-pressure conditions in central Maharashtra, causing rains, Deolankar said.

But the expert pointed out that rains recorded in low-intensity regions have also resulted in flooding or water stagnation.

This is because the concentration time has been reduced. “The time of concentration is the period required for rains to drop in the catchment area and flow downstream,” he said.

There are fewer hurdles due to rapid urbanisation and surface run-off allows water to flow faster, leading to flooding.

He added that delays in monsoons have already pushed the sowing season and the incessant rains may lead to losses.

“The rainy conditions are likely to improve after July 14. The rainfall and the weather conditions in the next two days will help us understand the gravity of losses,” Deolankar said.

Kumar said the data had been shared with the officials concerned, who will estimate the losses and issue guidelines for compensation to farmers.",0
798838,Heavy rains damage paddy crop in Bihar’s Seemanchal and Kosi regions,"Standing crops have been damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year

Unexpected heavy rainfall in October has ended the hopes of paddy farmers in northeastern Bihar’s Seemanchal and Kosi regions of getting a good crop this year.

Vinod Kumar, a scientist at the Araria Krishi Vigyan Kendra, told this reporter that heavy rains October 18 and 19, 2021 had damaged harvested paddy and also affected standing paddy.

“No one expected this. The rains have not only damaged paddy but will also delay cultivation of rabi crops such as potato due to waterlogging and moisture in fields,” Kumar said.

Satyendra Jha and Ravindar Yadav, who are marginal farmers of Araria district, were happy till last week as they expected a good paddy harvest either by the end of October or early next month.

But their hopes have been dashed after the heavy rains of the last 48 hours.

“Several farmers had harvested paddy and left it to dry in their fields. They would be hit hard. The rains have also damaged flowering paddy,” Yadav, a resident of a village under the Sikti block, said.

“The standing paddy is now submerged under rainwater and is unlikely to germinate as rains continue October 20. This will affect paddy output per hectare and quality as well,” Jha, a resident of a village near Forbesganj, said.

Pravin Kr Jha, Kishanganj district agriculture officer, said he has directed all block-level agriculture officials to survey and assess damage caused to paddy by heavy rains and submit a report soon.

“The magnitude of the damage will be known only after block agriculture officials submit their reports,” he added.

The state agriculture department had released the state’s official paddy production target of 118 lakh metric tonnes (MT) in August this year. The target last year was 90 lakh MT last year.

This year, paddy has been transplanted in nearly 72 per cent of the total 33 lakh hectares identified for production, as compared to 29.22 lakh hectares last year.

But last week, Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary in the state Cabinet, said repeated floods and surplus rains had damaged standing crops across thousands of hectares as farmland.

Read Bihar to give subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate crops due to waterlogging

Standing crops were damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year, according to the agriculture department’s assessment.

Farmers could not even sow in about 141,227 hectares this kharif season as large tracts of agricultural land remained under water due to excessive monsoon rainfall.

The state government for the first time earmarked Rs 100 crore in farm subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate on their land due to waterlogging.

Strange monsoon

This year, Bihar has received only three per cent surplus rainfall after the arrival of the monsoon on time. This is less than last year when the state received 25 per cent surplus rainfall from June to September.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal during July and August. But Bihar received surplus rainfall in June this year, just as the monsoon arrived. This resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.

Sanjay Kumar, weather scientist at the India Meteorological Department, Patna, said Bihar recorded surplus rainfall in June 2020 and 2021.

“This is the maximum rainfall the state has received in the last decade in June,” he said.

According to him, Bihar received 97.8 millimetres (mm) of rain in June 2019, nearly 40 per cent less than normal; 100.3 mm in 2018; 84.6 mm in 2017; 128.7 mm in 2016 and 123.6 mm in 2015.

After the monsoon had retreated from the region, Bihar has received 140.3 mm rainfall October 18-19, 2021, according to the India Meteorological Department. This was 157 per cent more the 54.7 mm the state usually receives at this time.

The rainfall was especially heavy in the Seemanchal and Kosi regions of the state.

Araria received 95 mm rainfall between October 18 and 19. Other places that received heavy showers included Kishanganj (67.45 mm), Katihar (66 mm), Khagaria (74.9 mm), Saharsa (74 mm), Supaul (50 mm) and Madhepura (45 mm).

The local meteorological office has forecast more rainfall in the coming two to three days.

798884,Cyclone Yaas: Acres of standing crop destroyed in Odisha’s ‘vegetable bowl’,"Farmers fear further losses if rainwater is not flushed out from the fields

Cyclone Yaas that made landfal in Odisha May 26, 2021, damaged large tracts of crops, affecting betel–vine farmers, paddy farmers and vegetable growers in Kendrapara, Balasore, Mayurbhanj and Bhadrak districts.

The unseasonal torrential rain and ferocious winds brought by Cyclone Yaas severely damaged large tracks of vegetables, black and green gram, groundnut and summer paddy crops across the districts.

“I lost all the groundnuts on my three-acre land. How will I repay the bank loan?” said Samarendra Barik from Gobindapur village, Kendrapara.

Millions of green betel leaves that is used to make paan have been ruined by the heavy rains and gusty winds, said Narendra Jena, a betel farmer from Dagara village, Balasore district. “This will impact around thirty thousand betel-vine farmers in the four districts.”

Around 150 villages were submerged by floods after Cyclone Yaas struck. The affected villages form the ‘vegetable bowl’ of Odisha as the riverside land in the villages are very fertile, said Ramachandra Pradhan, a vegetable grower of Rajkanika village.

Many farmers like him whose crops were ruined will require financial help from the government to bounce back, he added. “Cyclone Yaas has broken our backbone.”

The increase in groundwater might have destroyed vegetables that were sown early, farmers fear. “Brinjal, pointed gourd and other crops may also get diseased due to the untimely rain,” said Bijaya Behera, a vegetable cultivator from Chandabali village in Bhadrak district.

The crop loss has already triggered a price hike of vegetables that had become cheaper last month due to good weather, he added.

Ramaniranjan Routray, a farmer leader associated with All India Krishak Sabha, said:

The cyclone and floods have already washed away standing crops. A large numbers of farmers fear more losses if rainwater is not flushed out from their lands within a week.

The state government faced losses amounting to Rs 610 crores due to Cyclone Yaas, said Suresh Chandra Mohapatra, chief secretary, Government of Odisha.

Hundreds of farmers will bear the impact of crop loss and many might find it hard to recover. “Immediate steps will be taken to arrange and distribute quality certified seeds in sufficient quantities to the affected farmers,” added Mohapatra.

Rising prices of food items, particularly that of vegetables, have spiked retail inflation to a 68-month high of 7.59 per cent in January 2020, according to the National Statistical Office.

While the inflation figure captured headlines, a crucial analysis of the reasons behind this sustained increase in food prices slipped public attention. Extreme weather events have led to crop damages, leading to a collapse in the supply of vegetables at a time of the year when they usually flood the markets.

On the basis of year-on-year comparison, vegetable prices have gone up by 50.19 per cent since January 2019. They have spiked by 45.56 per cent in rural areas / markets during this period and by 59.31 per cent in urban areas.

Of the six categories of consumption items used to reach the overall inflation figure, the food and beverages category recorded the highest price rise, thus increasing the overall inflation rate.

Unseasonal rains and other weather events continue to disrupt the normal crop cycle and also crop yield. Since last year’s monsoon, at least 12 states have recorded longer spells of rains, spreading into the winter monsoon cycle of October-December.

A longer summer monsoon delayed sowing and harvesting. But it also raised the hope that higher moisture level would lead to higher Rabi crop yields. But during the winter monsoon — the primary season for vegetable crops — unusually high rainfall days were reported from across the country. It caused damages to standing crops.

In Matupali village of Odisha’s Subarnapur district, the weekly market is buzzing with one question: “Why is there no distress sale of vegetables?”

Like this market of an obscure village, difficult to pin point on the state map, shoppers in vegetable markets across Odisha find vegetable prices unusually high for this point of time.

Usually, in winter and particularly around February, seasonal vegetables like cauliflower and tomato crash to Rs 1-2 per kg. In Matupali’s market, cauliflower was selling at Rs 10 per kg and tomato at Rs 20 per kg respectively.

A typical weekly village market is usually the main market for local small producers and farmers. They have an explanation for this ‘price rise’ of vegetables. Since the monsoon last June-September, rains have continued; often they have experienced extreme spells of rains.

This has delayed the sowing and harvesting. As the rain continued till February, many standing vegetable crops got damaged. The farmers’ usual harvest has come down.

Even summer food grain crops like paddy had not been harvested till January-end. To sum up, the vegetable crop was delayed and got damaged in the continuing rains.

Even though a high retail price for vegetables would lead to better returns for farmers, their overall production has come down.

The erratic monsoon and more rainy days have already set the food inflation high since the last monsoon. Consumer food price inflation hit a six-year high of 14.12 per cent in December 2019.

One could gauge the impact of unfavourable weather events on food pricse from the fact that inflation picked up at fast pace, from 2.99 per cent in August 2019. In September 2019, it hit 5.11 per cent and in the next month, it reached to 7.89 per cent. In November 2019, inflation hit double digits — 10.01 per cent — for the first time since December 2013.

Way back in 2014, when inflation was an emotive political agenda, the Reserve Bank of India pointed out: “One of the traditional explanations for rising food prices has been the supply-side shocks related to weather either because of droughts or floods.”

Between 1956 and 2010, there were nine double-digit inflation episodes. Out of these, 77 per cent were caused by weather-related events like drought.

Non-profit Oxfam recently simulated the impacts of extreme weather events on price rise. According to this simulation: “The average price of staple foods such as maize could more than double in the next 20 years compared with 2010 trend prices (or by 2030) – with up to half of the increase due to changes in average temperatures and rainfall patterns.”

This simulation has another scary forecast that is relevant to India. It says that besides the price doubling by 2030, one or more extreme weather events could spike food prices to a level of two-decade cumulative price rise.

The fast food inflation during August-December 2019 in India could be an example of this when unseasonal and extreme weather events disrupted the crop cycle and damaged standing crops.

According to Oxfam, there would be a 107 per cent increase in the price of processed rice by 2030 due to extreme weather events.

“This scenario models the simultaneous occurrence of poor harvests in India and South East Asia and indicates that it could lead to an increase in 2030 in the global average export price of processed rice of around 25 per cent,” the Oxfam model forecasts.",0
799363,Farmers in Ladakh are among biggest victims of climate change',"After inventing the first artificial glacier in 1987, Chewang Norphel came to be known as “Ice Man of India”. He talks about how depleting glaciers and rains are affecting Ladakhis

How has the weather in Ladakh changed over the years?

When I was young, the region used to witness heavy snowfall (more than 3-3.65 m), half of which would gradually melt in the following months. But the last two decades have witnessed a decline in the rate of snowfall. Also, with prolonged summer and climate change, the remaining snow melts quickly. Even average annual rainfall is about only 50 mm. Our problem seems to be getting worse by the day. Though various studies have shown impact of climate change in the region, we don't need further studies to prove that the region is drastically affected by climate change. This year, Leh Ladakh witnessed much erratic rainfall. Moreover, since the flash floods of 2010, people in Leh have been living under a fear that more such extreme weather events will strike soon.

Have cropping patterns in the region changed with time? If yes, how?

With changing weather and precipitation level, cropping patterns have also undergone a transformation. Earlier, we used to get a bountiful harvest of wheat, paddy, barley, fruits and vegetables. But gradually, the streams dried. Now, potato, green peas and barley are like cash crops for the region. Alfalfa grass, a fodder for the cattle, also grows perennially in the region as a result of timely availability of water. It has to be sown only once. This has also helped farmers generate additional income. But with 20-30 per cent of villages depending on rivers for irrigation and rest relying on glacier melting waters, the changing patterns are posing a serious problem for farmers. We are thankful to god that at least the artificial glaciers are helping people get access to water when they need it the most.

Are these problems the reason behind your invention of artificial glaciers in the barren mountains?

Ladakh is a repository of glaciers. Working with farmers for over 30 years, I internalised their problems. I could see that it was very difficult for them to sow their crops in dearth of water. Moreover, the water from glacier melt is not available exactly when they need it. But the inspiration to build water-harvesting structures for them came after one day I saw in my garden that a tap that was kept open so that the water in the pipes does not freeze. Also, the water that came out of pipe froze quickly. That is when I thought that we could harvest water by making it freeze and not flow downstream.

Will artificial glaciers with improved versions benefit more people?

When I thought of making these glaciers, people laughed at me. But I feel honoured that my innovation has helped many farmers. Though a few people are now engaged in building upon what I had invented, it is unfortunate that we have not been able to garner much financial support for our innovation that has helped thousands of residents of water-starved Ladakh. Though we have managed our funds through crowdfunding, improvisation of these innovations, along with more use of technology, will need a lot more effort and money.

796629,Climate change escalates suicide rates among Marathwada farmers,"Farmer suicides have increased significantly and doubled in some regions where weather extremities incurred heavy losses

So far, 661 farmers from the Marathwada region alone have ended their lives. Representative photo: iStock

Farmer suicides in the Nanded district of Maharashtra’s Marathwada more than doubled since incessant rains caused severe crop damage in the region.

The suicide cases in Nanded jumped to 26 in August from eight in July, according to official estimates.

The total number of farmer suicides reported from the district in 2022 stood at 93 through August. And the officials have deemed 63 of these eligible for compensation of Rs one lakh.

There were 119 cases in the district in 2021 instead of 77 in 2020. And 65 of these farmers’ families received compensation.

Also watch: One agricultural labourer died by suicide every two hours in 2021

So far, 661 farmers from the Marathwada region alone have ended their lives. Some 485 of these have received compensation from the state government.

The maximum number of cases was reported in August, accounting for 114, followed by 108 in June, 101 in March and 83 in July.

Devastating losses due to extreme weather combined with heavy loan debts have pushed the farmers to take such extreme steps.

“Many farmers have been affected in the village and surrounding areas. Agricultural lands of about 20 per cent farmers have been washed away entirely,” said Pavan Karevad, head of the village Siranjani in Nanded.

Some of the farmers had resown the seeds after the first rains in July lashed their crops, he added.

Also read: Extreme rainfall damages nearly 4 million hectares of crops in Marathwada

Some 3,652,872 hectares of land have been severely affected due to the extreme rains in July, August and September, according to the figures from the divisional commissionerate, Aurangabad.

Agricultural losses coupled with damages incurred due to extreme weather have worsened the situation, according to farmers.

“My five acres of land got washed away along with the soybean and cotton. There is no possibility that I can resow the plantation or prepare the soil,” said Kiran Gade, a farmer from Himayatnagar in Nanded.

The entire soil has been eroded and it would be difficult to restore the fertility and the farmland for the upcoming season, he added.

Gade had invested over Rs 80,000 on his crop. “I had high hopes from the crops that would be harvested soon as last year. But the production was not as desired,” he added.

Such a situation makes it far worse to recuperate from the losses, he said. “It would take a few years to restore the land. Moreover, the government policies do not cover the heavy damages caused by the weather events,” he added.

I will be entitled to a sum of Rs 13,200 per hectare as assistance from the state government despite the land loss, he said.

“The amount received will not be enough even to cover the losses, compelling to take additional loans,” he added.

There is no provision to cover the wide-scale losses, said a senior official from Maharashtra’s agriculture department.

At present, the farmers are eligible to receive monetary compensation only if more than 33 per cent of their crop is damaged.

“The same compensation applies for farmers who have faced total loss of their agricultural land,” he added.

But such limited help and worsening conditions are also one of the reasons pushing farmers towards committing suicide.

Raju Gotamvad, a farmer from Parva village of Nanded, committed suicide July 14, according to the government records. He lost 2.5 acres of his soybean farm during the rains in 2021, resulting in heavy losses.

“Gotamvad had taken a loan at the rate of 4 per cent interest from a private lender. The interest escalated with the losses. Moreover, this year, he planted soybean on 1.5 acres and cotton on the remaining,” said Dnyaneshwar Mane, a villager.

The rains in June helped germinate the seeds, but the growth remained stunted as the rains did not occur for over a month. When the rains returned, they were more than required that the crops rotted, he said.

“Realising that this crop would also fail, Gotamvad ended his life. He knew he could not repay the Rs 2 lakh that he sought as a loan,” Mane added.

Climate change is altering seasonal patterns and pushing developmental trajectories beyond thresholds, Abinash Mohanty, a climate change expert and reviewer of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment report, told DTE.

“The monsoon of 2022 is a testament to how erratic, incessant and longer dry days are the new norms. They impact lives and livelihoods — especially across climate-dependent sectors like agriculture,” he added.

Climate change will make extreme events harsher and graver. Depressions are turning into cyclones and incessant and erratic rainfalls result in high-impact flood events, Mohanty added.

It is imperative to mainstream climate adaptations through systemic and financial re-orientation to climate-proof the livelihoods of small and marginalised farmers. Key decision-makers should re-orient climate actions, fund it and fight to mitigate the impacts, he said.",0
121,RAIN-TRIGGERED FLOODS IN BANGLADESH CONJURE CLIMATE WARNINGS," Scientists say that climate change was likely to have made the the rains that unleashed catastrophic flooding across Bangladesh worse.

While South Asia's monsoon rains follow natural atmospheric patterns, the rains will become more erratic and torrential as global temperatures continue to climb, scientists say.

It would take months to determine exactly how much of a role climate change played in last week's heavy rains.

But scientists note that warmer air can hold more water vapor before rain clouds eventually burst, meaning more rain eventually pours down.

""The strong monsoon winds in the Bay of Bengal can carry a lot more moisture,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. ""The large amount of rainfall that we see now might be a climate change impact.""

The South Asia monsoon season, from June to September, is governed by several, overlapping patterns in the ocean and atmosphere, including the El Nino-La Nina weather cycle and the Indian Ocean Dipole. Currently, those systems are driving strong, southwesterly winds over the Bay of Bengal.

But the monsoon patterns have shifted in recent decades, as the average temperature for Bangladesh has risen at least 0.5 degrees Celsius since 1976.

""Instead of having moderate rains spread out through the monsoon season, we have long dry periods intermittently with short spells of heavy rains,"" Koll said. ""When it rains, it dumps all that moisture in a few hours to a few days.""

On Tuesday, Bangladeshi troops were navigating dinghys through brackish floodwaters to rescue those in need or deliver food and water to some of the 9.5 million people marooned. Officials say at least 69 people have died in the disaster.

Last week's heavy rains, which caused Bangladesh's rivers to breach their banks, followed less than a month after the neighboring Indian state of Assam was hit by similar rain-triggered flooding, which killed at least 25 people there.

Bangladesh is considered one of the world's most climate-vulnerable countries, with a 2015 analysis by the World Bank Institute estimating about 3.5 million Bangladeshis are at risk of river flooding every year. The floods also threaten the country�s agriculture, infrastructure and clean water supply.

The region's countries ""all suffer if there�s no rain. They suffer when there�s too much rain,"" said Anders Levermann, a climate scientist at Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and Columbia University. ""What they would need is a steady rainfall, as we had in the past and as is threatened now under global warming."" (Reporting by Gloria Dickie; Editing by Katy Daigle and Angus MacSwan)",0
123,HEATWAVES INCREASING IN INDIA BUT RELATED DEATHS FALL,"NEW DELHI, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Temperatures during India's monsoon season have risen this century and the country could see more frequent heatwaves in future, the government said on Wednesday, but it added heat-related deaths have fallen in recent years.

India suffered its hottest March in more than a century this year and temperatures were unusually high in April and May too, mainly blamed on climate change. The government says heatwaves are common mainly between April and June.

""The average temperature during the monsoon season is found to be rising in the last two decades,"" India's science and technology and earth sciences minister, Jitendra Singh, told parliament.

""The warming of the tropical Indian Ocean and more frequent El Nino events in future may lead to more frequent and long-lasting heatwaves over India.""

El Nino is characterised by a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific. It causes heavy rains and floods in South America and scorching weather in Asia and even east Africa.

Singh said India's mean temperature during the June-September monsoon season rose to nearly 28.4 degrees Celsius (83.1�F) last year from less than 28 degrees Celsius in 2001.

Heatwave deaths, however, have come down in recent years, according to data provided by Singh to lawmakers that cited newspaper reports.

For this year through July, India recorded 24 such fatalities, versus none for the whole of last year, and 25 in 2020. That compares with a multi-year high of 505 deaths in 2019.

The minister did not say why there have been fewer fatalities in recent years, but a government official earlier told Reuters that most Indian states now have plans ready to alter office and school timings as well as working hours for labourers to avoid the hottest time of day, in a bid to reduce exposure.",0
796630,Extreme rainfall damages nearly 4 million hectares of crops in Marathwada,"Incessant rains through the month of August and September have affected 4.48 million farmers this season

Farmers in Maharashtra’s Marathwada region suffered yet another severe blow due to incessant rains during August and September. This comes after the farmers had incurred severe losses worth crores of rupees during July, 2022.

Over 4.48 million farmers have suffered severe crop damage and this may increase over the coming months, according to the divisional commissionerate, Aurangabad.

Some 3,652,872 hectares (ha) of land have been affected due to the unexpected rains, of which 35,34,371 ha are rain-fed. Around 68,391 ha come under irrigation and 5,0,109 ha fall under horticulture.

The total sowing area in the Aurangabad, Beed and Latur districts was reported to be about 2,067,896 hectares this season, according to official estimates.

The division received rains in the last three weeks of September, making it over 100 per cent above normal. Aurangabad district received 165 per cent, 113 per cent and 130 per cent of rainfall between September 1 and 21, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

Beed received 122 and 116 per cent rainfall for the weeks September 7-14 and September 14-21 respectively. Latur, Jalna and Parbhani, Osmanabad and Hingoli districts also received excess rainfall resulting in large-scale crop damages.

Bapurao Kurumkar, a marginal farmer from the Beed district, said all his crops were damaged in the rains.

“September is the month when crops start bearing fruit and harvest begins. But just when I was about to harvest tur (pigeon pea) and soyabean, the rains caused severe damage,” he told DTE.

Kurumkar said his cotton plantation was also under threat. “I have planted all the crops in three acres (1.21 ha) of land and I fear that all the crops will be lost,” he said.

The cotton starts bearing pods and the October heat would have facilitated it. But with excess rains, the pods have been damaged, he added.

Farmers have started taking precautions to avoid any infestation as well.

“The unexpected rains make cotton crops vulnerable to infestation. I have sprayed insecticides and pesticides for the fifth time this season. However, the exercise has increased the input cost by three times,” said Dastagir Pathan, another farmer from Beed district.

The cost of spraying pesticides through the season has increased to Rs 60,000 due to incessant rains, said Dastagir, who co-owns six-acre (2.42 ha) with his two brothers.

“If I sell cotton, I am likely to earn the same amount of money. Given the heavy expenses, there will be no profits to sustain. Our fight is only to save the crops from extreme weather,” he added.

Other farmers from Marathwada told DTE they feared the remaining crops would also suffer damage if the rains continued.

The effect of the La Nina weather phenomenon will continue until year-end, resulting in more rains, including in the Indian subcontinent, stated the World Meteorological Organization, in its recent report.

The district administration officials have already started field inspections to assess crop damages. However, only limited relief has been disbursed by the state government

The divisional commissionerate has estimated damages to the tune of Rs 376,223 for farmers who have suffered more than 33 per cent of crop loss, making them eligible for crop damage compensation from the state government.

Funds worth Rs 1,688 crore have already been received from the state government, said Sunil Kendrekar, the divisional commissioner. “More funds will be requested as the reports of damages are updated and losses and measured,” he added.",0
798766,Chilli under attack: New thrips species destroys farms in 6 states,"Farmers are being pushed to suicide amid market shortage

A labourer dries chillies at a farm in Lakshmipuram village in Telangana's Hanumakonda district, which lost 51 per cent of its chilli crops to a new species of thrips this year

Chilli farmers in Telangana’s Subakkapalli village, Bhopalapalli district, are living their worst nightmare. A new pest, black thrips (Thrips parvispinus), has destroyed over 40 hectares (ha) of standing crop in a matter of months.

In Sidduri Ravindra Rao’s farm, the initial signs of the attack were reported in the first week of December last year. He increased the frequency of pesticide spraying to three times a week from the recommended two times, but the entire crop on his 0.8 hectares farm perished within a week.

On December 15, he died by suicide. His brother Bhaskar Rao told Down To Earth that Ravindra was relying on this year’s produce to repay his loan of over Rs 20 lakh. “First, untimely heavy rainfall destroyed our crops. This season, we lost it to pest attacks,” he said.

Farmers in Jairam Thanda village in Warangal district also narrate similar stories. The black-coloured and pinhead-sized pest has ruined the entire 20 ha under chilli in the village.

Banath Venkamma, a chilli farmer from the village, says when he first saw the pest on his 0.4-ha farm, he contacted the local agriculture extension office, which recommended continuing with the existing pesticides.

“I used at least six different pesticides but nothing worked. The pest has completely destroyed 70 per cent of my crop and has partially destroyed the remainder. Usually, chillies we grow are 7 to 10 centimetres long, but this time they are barely 5 cm long,” she said.

Rapid spread

T parvispinusis, a member of the thrips group of sucking pests, is an invasive species from Southeast Asia that has been documented in different countries including Australia, Thailand and Greece.

It causes more damage than S dorsalis, the thrips pest native to India. By attacking the flowers and not just leaves, T parvispinusis removes any hope of the crop growing from it. The pest was first reported in India in 2017 when it destroyed papaya farms in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

“This is the first time it has caused such widespread destruction in the country. In the past year, its population has increased by many folds,” said V Sridhar, principal scientist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Institute of Horti-cultural Research in Bengaluru. He is part of the team of scientists appointed by the Centre to research the pest attack and its possible management solutions.

As per the information received by the team, since October 2021, the pest has caused widespread losses in hundreds of villages across 34 contagious districts in six states:

Telangana

Andhra Pradesh

Maharashtra

Karnataka

Tamil Nadu

Chhattisgarh

They have also received information about similar attacks in Gujarat. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are, however, the worst-hit, where at least 0.36 million ha — roughly three times the size of Delhi — has been destroyed. The remaining states have not released official figures so far.

T parvispinusis is also polyphagous, which means it spreads to other crops. The Central team’s scientists visited farms in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka between October and December 2021 and found the pest in sweet pepper, brinjal, black gram, pigeon pea, watermelon, cucumber, bottle gourd, mango, and cotton, among others.

“This was not on a large scale, but the presence was noted,” Sridhar said.

Without a cover

The growing spread of the pest in India is worrying for two reasons.

First, the country is the world’s largest producer, consumer and exporter of chillies and has 40 per cent of the world’s area under the crop.

Second, chilli cultivation requires huge investment ranging anywhere between Rs 2.5-3 lakh per ha.

In Telangana, most chilli farmers pay an additional Rs 20,000-25,000 to take land on lease. This year, the farmers say their investment in pesticides also shot up because of the attack. In such a situation, the crop loss has pushed many farmers to the brink.

DTE in last week of March visited six villages in four districts of Telangana and found several cases of farmer suicides. While the state government has not released any numbers, a survey by Telangana-based non-profits Rythu Swarajya Vedika and Human Rights Forum shows that more than 50 farmers have died by suicide in the districts of Warangal, Mahbubabad, Hanumakonda, Bhopalapalli, Khammam and Bhadradri Kothagudem.

In Subakkapalli village of Bhopalapalli, Bhaskar Rao blames the government for the deaths of his brother and other farmers. “Nobody came to talk to us or make us aware of the pest or how to deal with it. We were making our own guesses,” Bhaskar Rao said.

Telangana is yet to announce compensation for the crop damage. The state does not have its own crop insurance scheme and has also opted out of the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Bima Fasal Yojana.

The state government runs the cash support scheme, Rythu Bandhu, under which Rs 12,350 per ha per season is transferred to the bank accounts of farmers ahead of the rabi and kharif seasons. Another scheme, Rythu Bima, promises Rs 5 lakh to the families of farmers who have died by suicide.

But these are not enough. Hari Krishna of the Human Rights Forum says by introducing Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima schemes the government has absolved itself of the responsibility for crop loss. Besides, only landed families benefit from the schemes; vulnerable landless farmers are simply not covered, he adds.

Though the state announces compensation packages during large-scale crop loss, Kiran Kumar Vissa of Rythu Swarajya Vedika says it seldom reaches people. “Farmers are still waiting for the compensation announced in January 2021 for crop loss caused by heavy rainfall,” Vissa alleged.

Ripple effect

MV Madhusudhan, deputy director of Telangana’s horticulture department, agrees that the pest attack has substantially reduced the yield of chilli this year — from the usual 5-6 tonnes per ha to 2.5 tonnes or less.

Its effect can be seen at the Warangal mandi, Asia’s second largest chilli market. In February and March 2022, the mandi received 27,514 tonnes of chillies, nearly half of what it got in the two months last year (52,106 tonnes).

“The pest attack and the hailstorm in January have created a supply problem. There could be a high shortage of red chillies in the coming months in the market,” said BV Rahul, selection grade secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Warangal.

The price of the crop has already skyrocketed. Currently, average mandi price of chilli is Rs 1.8-2 lakh per tonne, which is almost double the usual rate of Rs 1.1-1.3 lakh. “On March 30, a farmer received a record price of Rs 5.2 lakh a tonne because there is an acute shortage of good quality chillies this season,” said Rahul.

Farmers said the inflated price will not do them any good as the yield is low. They are now worried about a similar attack in the next crop season.

Conducive climate

On February 4, 2022, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar said in Parliament that the change in climatic conditions during the cropping season might be responsible for the spread of T parvispinus.

Scientists agree that weather aberrations could have aided in the proliferation of the pest. “Thrips usually proliferate in hot and dry conditions, but this particular species, T parvispinus, thrives in hot and humid conditions,” said Sridhar.

Warangal and nearby districts received heavy rainfall in September, October and November 2021. During the southwest monsoon, the state received 40 per cent more rain than usual.

In the second week of January this year, several parts of Telangana had experienced hailstorms and heavy rains. Continuous stretches of crops further allowed the pest to spread rapidly. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli cultivation has increased by 30-35 per cent in the past one year.

The pest is also known to displace formerly established species from habitats. This has been seen in Indonesia and is now being observed in India as well. This year, it has replaced S dorsalis. This could have happened due to indiscriminate use of pesticides.

Farmers told DTE that unapproved pesticides are being sold at shops, and since they are cheaper than the approved ones, distressed farmers use them freely.

“As the replacement was observed this year alone, we need to monitor the various chilli pest species to understand if this is permanent or temporary,” said Sridhar.

He added that the pest has to be tackled in an integrated way from the first sight: “Farmers have to use blue-coloured sticky traps and all farmers must use the same methods to keep the pests away.”

A 2021 paper from scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources, Bengaluru, recommends destroying infected crop fields to stop the spread of the pest to newer locations.

It added that constant monitoring, microbial biopesticide-based management practices, such as the use of neem oil, pongamia oil, or soap solution in heavily infested sites, and judicious use of chemical insecticides as well as fertilisers.",0
799068,Why an American farmer commits suicide,"Like their India counterparts, American farmers are losing income, piling up debt and nobody listens to them

On November 5, the Senate of Wisconsin didn’t confirm the nomination of Brad Pfaff as agriculture secretary. It led to a political fisticuff between Democrat and Republican senators. The latter voted against him as he criticised the federal government for not releasing funds for mental health and suicide prevention services for farmers.

Wisconsin has recorded a 50 per cent dip in farm income in the six years since 2011. In 2017, it reported a record 915 suicides, mostly among the farming community.

This news from the United States has Indian hues — agrarian crisis, farmers’ suicides and political debates over them. But it is also surprising, given the political fallout.

Just imagine an agriculture minister of an Indian state being thrown out for asking more for farmers. Before that though we Indians would ask in disbelief: Do American farmers commit suicide out of distress?

It is a time of deepening distress for American farmers:

Chuck Grassley and Jon Tester, the US Senate’s only farmer members, recently introduced the Seeding Rural Resilience Act. The law aims at tackling the country’s rising rate of farmer suicide due to dipping income.

US-based non-profit Farm Aid reported that its farmer hotline recorded 109 per cent increase in distress calls last year.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that suicide rate among farming communities is 1.5 times higher than the national average.

Like in India in recent years, the US doesn’t have reliable data on farmers’ suicide.

An American farmer’s unfortunate path to suicide has all Indian features. Since 2013, farmers in the US have suffered a near 49 per cent dip in net income from farming due to crash in commodity prices. In fact, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates that more than half of US farmers currently have a negative farm income.

Increasingly, farmers are quitting farms and compensating income more from non-farm sources, just like in India. Those who are left in farming are increasingly becoming vulnerable due to increasing inputs cost.

Farm production costs increased by 4.4 per cent in 2017-18. Add to it, decreasing loan disbursal by banks: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated a 17.5 per cent dip in top banks’ lending to farmers between December 2015 and March 2019.

What has added to a brewing crisis is the ongoing US-China trade war. In a tit-for-tat, both countries have imposed tariffs on produce that include agricultural commodity.

Farmers from US exported a lot to China, a market that has shrunk for them in the last one-and-a-half years: from Chinese imports worth $20-26 billion a year (until 2017) to only $9.2 billion in 2018.

In 2018 and 19 the US government has pumped $28 billion in cash support to farmers helping them tide over the crisis. But the problem is more structural.

The money was like India's PM-Kisan cash support scheme, that can offer farmers only a small reprieve. It can’t help make terms of the trade supportive for farmers.

US agriculture has been systematically corporatised to such an extent that a few corporations control up to 80 per cent of the business. And those sustaining mostly on external markets. Once that is disturbed, they collapse. In fact, farm companies have increasingly declared bankruptcy in the last one-and-a-half years.

This leaves the individual farmers feeling orphaned, from their traditional livelihood and also from the government that they need the most now.",0
796763,"How COVID-19 controls hit farmers in 7 low-income countries, most in Africa","In countries with strictest controls, 80% smallholder households reported major disruptions

Since its emergence more than two years ago, COVID-19 has reached nearly every corner of the globe. It has infected hundreds of millions of people, and overwhelmed health systems worldwide. But its impact goes beyond its direct health consequences.

Measures to contain its spread – such as travel restrictions and lockdowns – have also had severe consequences for economies and food systems worldwide.

Despite the global impact, the consequences of pandemic-related restrictions vary widely among individuals. In the West, massive stimulus spending has helped ease the economic burden of the lockdowns. In low and middle-income countries, steep drops in employment and income have rivalled or exceeded those in richer nations.

But most people in poor countries have received no financial support and have few or no savings to fall back on.

Research shows that a disproportionate burden of pandemic-related restrictions has fallen on the world’s poorest. This has raised the question of how to best adapt the mitigation efforts to different types of economies.

My colleagues and I sought to shed light on this issue. Our research examined the impact of pandemic restrictions on smallholder farmers in low and middle-income countries.

In line with existing research on the negative impacts of pandemic restrictions, farmers in low and middle income countries reported that COVID-19 measures negatively affected food purchase, income generation and access to inputs.

Food security

The focus on smallholder farmers is pertinent. This group contributes most of the food production in many countries. They are also vulnerable to food insecurity and poverty.

We conducted more than 9,000 interviews with smallholder farmers from Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Vietnam and Zambia. The seven countries reflect the diversity of COVID-19 containment measures, and all rely heavily on smallholders for food supply.

The containment measures ranged from no restrictions in Burundi and Tanzania, to closures of public spaces, mandatory quarantines, and travel restrictions in Rwanda and Vietnam. This diversity allowed us to assess how the severity of COVID-19 restrictions affected smallholder farmers’ livelihoods and food security.

Our findings also indicate that the severity of these impacts was directly related to the stringency of the measures.

For countries with the strictest control, up to 80 per cent of smallholder households reported major disruptions, largely in their ability to purchase food due to high prices and closed markets.

Under stringent regulations, most smallholders also reported income reductions averaging 50%. The drop was due to few work opportunities, low prices for agricultural goods, and difficulty in accessing markets. This affected households with off-farm and on-farm incomes alike.

In contrast, negative economic and food security outcomes were less frequent and less severe in locations with relaxed measures. Only around 20% of smallholders reported negative outcomes in Burundi and Tanzania. This supports the growing connection between stringent restrictions and rising poverty and food insecurity in vulnerable areas.

Government support

Reports of lost income and difficulty in purchasing food are not unique to smallholder farmers in low and middle-income countries. People around the world have either lost jobs or seen empty grocery store shelves when the pandemic first hit.

What separates the experience of smallholder farmers of poor countries from their counterparts in the West is government aid, and the resulting coping tactics.

The overwhelming majority of farmers we interviewed said they had received no official aid. Unable to turn to their government for support, up to 80% of smallholder farmers in areas under stringent control were forced to reduce their food consumption. Other coping methods included the sale of livestock, unplanned crop sale, drawing down of savings and taking risky loans.

These findings have profound implications because coping methods reduce the buffering capacity of smallholder households and make them vulnerable to future shocks. In many poor smallholder households, coping ways likely forced them into deprivation.

Overall, our results draw further attention to the policy choice between lives and livelihoods. It reveals an almost impossible trade-off between saving lives from the pandemic and losing lives due to deprivation.

Our findings are supported by recent economic analyses showing that the cost-benefit ratio of COVID-19 measures can differ significantly by country. The optimal lockdown is likely to be less stringent in low and middle-income countries seeking to prevent deprivation.

Researchers are not the only ones catching on to this. A recent media analysis of how the pandemic was discussed in five African countries shows that popular media recognised the food insecurity impacts long before many of the scientific studies had been published. Popular narratives framed the situation as a balance between virus containment and food security. This eventually influenced governments to adapt official policy responses and loosen restrictions.

In other words, the world is slowly coming to the realisation that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research shows that stringent measures can successfully prevent excess deaths. But if these measures are introduced in poor countries without the requisite financial assistance, they can undermine the health of the very people they intended to protect.

What works for poor countries

Therefore, the suitability of any crisis mitigation depends on the needs of local populations as well as the capacity of local government to support them.

Crisis mitigation must guard against the exhaustion of buffering capacity in vulnerable households. Potential policy measures to ensure this include tiered mobility restrictions that allow travel for economic reasons, short-term price guarantees to stabilise the food system, and direct aid to rural households.

As governments fight this pandemic and prepare for future crises, they can no longer shy away from thinking through the trade-offs between restrictions and well-being. When COVID-19 struck, we were not prepared to make informed decisions about the trade-offs. The world’s poorest have borne the brunt of the consequences.

Our latest study is part of a growing body of research that provide tools we need to confront these trade-offs. By considering costs and benefits to local populations, policymakers can craft measures that save lives and protect livelihoods of the most vulnerable.

798959,Nigeria’s COVID-19 economic plan has delivered disappointing results: Here’s why,"Nigerian economy grew at 2.2% in 2019. It contracted by 1.8% in 2020. It rebounded in 2021 with a growth rate of 2.5%, but the rebound was less than expected

Over a year ago, Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari launched an economic plan designed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Nigeria has recorded 207,618 cases of infection and 2,745 deaths as of October 11, 2021. The economic effects were devastating. Economic growth turned negative in 2020, unemployment and poverty rates increased, and companies went out of business.

Dubbed “Bouncing Back: Nigeria Economic Sustainability Plan”, Buhari’s COVID-19 plan focused on food security, job creation (especially for young people and women), renewable energy, support for small and medium-size enterprises, manufacturing, infrastructure and social investment.

Cash transfers through N-Power, MarketMoni, TraderMoni and other initiatives were cornerstones of the plan.

Now it is time to assess whether the economy has bounced back or is on track to do so.

Prior to the pandemic, the Nigerian economy grew at 2.2% in 2019. It contracted by 1.8% in 2020. It rebounded in 2021 with a growth rate of 2.5%. But the rebound was less than expected, considering that sub-Saharan African countries grew at an average rate of 3.4%.

It is unclear whether Nigeria’s growth resurgence is attributable to the economic sustainability plan or to the increase in the oil price. The price increased from US$41 a barrel in December 2019 to US$67 in December 2020.

Oil is a major driver of growth in Nigeria, accounting for about 65% of government revenue and over 90% of foreign exchange earnings. In 2010, when the oil price reached a record high of $110, Nigeria’s economic growth was 11.3%.

Nigeria could raise its economic growth by three-fourths of a percent if it improved its low-quality infrastructure.

Political instability also hinders growth.

## Agriculture and food

The economic sustainability plan prioritised agricultural development and food security. Early indications suggest that this goal is not being accomplished.

Under the plan, the government intended to cultivate between 20,000 and 100,000 hectares of new farmland in each of the country’s 36 states. This should have enabled the growth of agriculture value added to hold steady at the 2019 level of 2.4%. But it grew by only 2.2% in 2020.

Other African countries had higher rates of agricultural development than Nigeria by the end of 2020. Examples are South Africa (13.1%), Senegal (8.2%), Ghana (7.4%) Angola (6.9%) and Gabon (5.2%).

Given Nigeria’s annual population growth rate of about 2.6%, it means that food supply lagged demand in 2020. This explains the rising food prices. The composite food index rose by 21% in July 2021.

In his Independence Day speech on 1 October 2021, President Buhari blamed hoarders for Nigeria’s food inflation. Yet hoarding typically occurs when demand exceeds supply, and when sellers expect prices to continue to rise.

The antidote to hoarding is a massive increase in agricultural production, which the economic sustainability plan has so far not achieved.

Small business

Many of the initiatives under the plan were designed to prevent businesses, especially small and medium scale enterprises, from failing.

The pause in the repayment of loans granted by the Central Bank of Nigeria to the recipients of its intervention programmes was extended by a year. The interest rate on the bank’s loans was cut from 9% to 5%. And the bank created a loan facility of 50 billion naira or US$122 million for affected households and small and medium enterprises.

Yet these businesses have continued to struggle for survival. Of the 3,000 enterprises surveyed by the United Nations Development Programme and the National Bureau of Statistics, 80% said they reduced production in 2020. One in three said they knew of at least one business that had closed permanently. About 60% of the firms had endured an unexpected increase in “operational costs”.

In addition to supporting smaller businesses, the Central Bank of Nigeria established a 1 trillion naira (US$2.4 billion) facility in April 2020 for supporting manufacturing. Of this amount, 300 billion naira (US$732 million) had been disbursed as of March 2021.

This intervention may have given an impetus to foreign direct investment, which rose slightly from $2.3 billion in 2019 to $2.4 billion in 2020. This could have been through the provision of loans to foreign manufacturers to establish subsidiaries in Nigeria. And it would have been a positive signal to foreign investors.

COVID-19 interventions increased Nigeria’s manufacturing value added as a percentage of GDP only marginally, from 11.5% of GDP in 2019 to 12.6% in 2020.

Shallow economic rebound

The International Monetary Fund expects Nigeria’s economic growth to be flat at about 2.3% for the next two years. By contrast, it is estimated that sub-Saharan African countries will grow at an average of 4% during the same period.

This implies that the Nigerian economy is not on track to rebound at a scale needed to significantly reduce the high unemployment and poverty rates.

A report by the United Nations Development Programme and the National Bureau of Statistics shows the unemployment rate in Nigeria increased from 27% in the second quarter of 2020 to 33% in the fourth quarter of the same year. Youth unemployment was 42.5% as of July 2021. The report found that 20% of the workers in the enterprises surveyed lost their jobs in 2020.

The World Bank estimates that 11 million Nigerians will be pushed into poverty by 2022, in addition to the 100 million (out of 200 million people in the country) who are already classified as poor.

The Nigerian economy would have to grow at between 8% and 10% a year for at least 10 years before the current poverty rate of 40% could be halved. On the current trends, this is very unlikely to happen.

Poor economic outlook

With flat economic growth and rising inflation of about 17%, Nigeria risks running into what economists refer to as “stagflation”. Stagflation is a lethal combination of high unemployment and inflation rates. Rising food prices and steep depreciation of the Nigerian currency are the main causes of inflation in Nigeria.

An attempt to rein in inflation by raising interest rates would worsen economic growth and increase unemployment. Conversely, a strategy of promoting economic growth by reducing interest rates could push up inflation.

All indications are that Buhari’s COVID-19 plan has not stemmed the worsening unemployment and poverty in Nigeria and has resulted in only marginal improvements in economic growth, manufacturing and foreign direct investment.

The plan was not bold and big enough. There should have been massive investment in agro-processing industries, which would have created jobs for millions of unemployed Nigerian youths.

For instance, of the 2.3 trillion naira ($5.6 billion) that the government planned to spend on the economic sustainability plan, only 500 billion naira ($1.2 billion), or one-fifth, was spent as of May 2021.

The plan should have focused more on reviving the textile and footwear industries in the country. These industries are labour-intensive, and employed thousands of Nigerians in the 1970s and 1980s.

Transferring cash to a few Nigerians, supporting some small and medium scale enterprises, and saving 2 million jobs as claimed by the government are inadequate for uplifting the lives of millions of Nigerians who continue to endure prolonged unemployment and extreme poverty.

798835,Nagaland paddy farmers worry over drought-like conditions,"Paddy is grown mostly for self-consumption in Nagaland. A drought-like situation due to deficit rainfall has affected cultivation

The production of paddy in Nagaland, mostly grown for self-consumption, has been severely affected due to persistent drought-like conditions in the hilly state. This has caused distress among farmers and their families.

The rainfall patterns in the region have considerably changed, and the state is drying up. It has been experiencing a drought-like situation due to deficit rainfall this year.

Most households don’t have any mechanism to store water and depend on rivers and rivulets for water supply to their fields.

“But the water bodies have gone dry. The sowing of paddy starts in June. It is harvested in November. But most farmers couldn’t sow because of the shortage of rainfall,” said Seyie Kuotsu (35), a paddy farmer.

“I have been growing paddy for the past several years but have never witnessed a situation like this before,” said Kedilezo Mkebitsu (70), who grows paddy in his two-acre land at Zhadmia village in Kohima district.

Mkebitsu harvests around 1,000 kilograms of paddy every year for self-consumption, as the production is not enough for sale in the market. “But this year, it is difficult to harvest even half the regular produce.”

Kuotsu voiced similar concerns: “We depend heavily on paddy. The rain-fed crop is grown just once a year and lasts for several months.”

The duo claimed that around 800 families involved in farming in Zhadima alone have been facing a tough time.

The entire state, in fact, has been reeling under severe drought-like conditions this year. As many as 66,222 households spread across 12 districts of the state have been affected, according to the Nagaland agriculture department.

The total area of land affected is around 49,448.85 hectares. Dimapur district is the worst affected: 9,408 households and 14,995 hectares of land have been hit hard.

Pulses, vegetables, oilseeds and pumpkin have also faced the brunt of the water crisis, said farmers.

The farmers in the hilly state also faced a huge infestation of fall armyworm (FAW) early this year that affected around 3048.45 hectares of maize crop covering 334 villages.

Jhum farmers suffer

The crisis has also affected Jhum farming (shifting cultivation) in the state. Land is cleared by burning the vegetation, is cultivated for several years, and then abandoned in favour of another site when the productivity of soil declines.

“The shortage of rainfall has also impacted the quality of paddy. The king chilli got damaged due to the drought. We have not received any compensation from the government,” Kenei Welie (42), a farmer in Kohima district, said.

The total area of Nagaland is 16,579 square kilometers, out of which 947 sq km are under jhum cultivation.

The delayed rains have hit about 915 villages, which include 686.62 sq km of jhum fields and 5.25 sq km of horticultural crops, according to the state agriculture department.

Apart from jhum, terraced rice farming (upland) and wet terraced rice cultivation have also been affected. The state produced 551,000 tonnes of rice in 2020; it is expected to be around 166,000 tonnes this year.

Senior government officials conceded that the state is inching towards an agrarian crisis and urged the central government to look into the matter.

“We are facing the twin problems of water shortage and climate change. We are yet to assess the total monetary loss to agriculture as the harvesting will continue till December. We believe that our traditional way of cultivation is not economically viable and ecologically sustainable anymore,” said Y Kikheto Sema, agriculture production officer, Nagaland.

“The topography of our state is different from that of other states. We are suffering from a severe water crisis, but the question of doubling farm produce has not come up. The Union government should focus more on the construction of check dams and reservoirs. It should rejuvenate water bodies,” he added.",0
799109,It's time we shift farmers' economic burden,"Assured net income, including assured minimum support price for crops, can put an end to farmer suicide cases in India

Almost eight years ago, Avtaar Singh committed suicide after he failed to repay farm loan. In November 2017, his two sons, 40-year-old Roop Singh and 32-year-old Basant Singh, followed suit by jumping into the Bhakra canal. They were residents of Patiala district of Punjab. Together, the brothers owned some 1 hectare (ha) of farmland and had taken another 12 ha on lease. Yet they were unable to generate profits, and the outstanding debt continued to swell. After all, how long could they draw credit from multiple sources to repay the initial loan amount? The vicious cycle of mounting indebtedness eventually took its toll, and consumed two generations of the family.

The tragedy that struck the family in Punjab symbolises the agony that the entire farming community of the country is living with. Hardly a day goes by without reports of farmers committing suicide hogging the headlines. In the past 21 years, more than 320,000 farmers have taken their own lives in one part of the country or the other—this means every 41 minute a farmer is ending his life somewhere in the country. Those who have refrained from taking the extreme step fare no better. They continue to somehow survive, living in acute distress, and hoping against hope. Several studies have shown that 58-62 per cent of farmers go to bed on an empty stomach.

Farmers are in reality the victims of a flawed economic design. A recent report by global analytical company CRISIL points to the denial of the rightful income to farmers as the major reason behind the agrarian crisis sweeping through the country. “While the average annual growth in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) [for crops] was 19.3 per cent between 2009 and 2013, it was only 3.6 per cent between 2014 and 2017,” the report states. My analysis shows that this minimal increase in MSP does not even correspond to the annual rise in the dearness allowance (DA is a cost of living adjustment allowance) received by government employees. In 1970, school teachers were receiving about Rs 90 a month. Their salary jumped by 280 to 320 times by 2015. During the same 45-year period, the salary of government employees increased by 120 to 150 times; and that of college professors by 150 to 170 times. On the contrary, wheat price for farmers has increased by just 19 times during the period.

Let’s see whether their net returns have increased. In Maharashtra, which has been facing massive silent protests by Marathas, the net return per hectare of paddy is Rs 966, according to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) that computes the net returns. This means, if a farmer worked on a monthly basis, his income would be less than Rs 300 per hectare. For cotton, the net return is Rs 2,949 per hectare. But considering that cotton is sown in June and harvesting begins in October and often continues till January, the average monthly income comes to a paltry Rs 700 per hectare. For certain crops, Maharashtra farmers actually incur losses: Rs 10,674 a hectare for ragi (finger millet), Rs 5,873 a hectare for moong (green gram) and Rs 6,663 a hectare for urad (black gram). This, I believe, is the primary reason for the discontent in the state.

Viewed from the national level, the net returns for crops like paddy, sugarcane, maize and cotton have actually declined in the past three years. The returns are in the negative for most dryland crops. If the farmer is destined to harvest losses, I wonder what kind of technological and financial support can bail them out. Access to more credit, even if it comes from institutional agencies like banks, has only pushed them further into the debt trap. As former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh once remarked: “A farmer is born in debt and dies in debt.”

The mandate for CACP, which works out MSP, is not only to provide an assured price to farmers but also to ensure that it does not lead to inflationary pressures. The prices therefore are deliberately kept low; in many cases the prices are even less than the cost of production. This economic design is not peculiar to India; it is global. This is the reason, John F Kennedy had once said: “Farmer is the only man in our economy who buys everything at retail, sells everything at wholesale and pays for freight both ways.” But what is not being realised is that farmers in the US or in Europe receive massive subsidies, including Direct Income Support, whereas Indian farmers receive only input subsidies that in reality benefit the manufacturers.

In fact, successive governments have conveniently passed the burden of keeping food prices low on to farmers. In other words, it’s the farmer who bears the entire cost of subsidising food for consumers. Farmers are deliberately paid less, kept impoverished. Still, what farmers do not realise is that every time they take to cultivation, they actually cultivate losses. Farm income remains almost frozen or bare enough to cover only the cost of production. Keeping food prices low is also in consonance with the dominant economic thinking aimed at drastically reducing the workforce in agriculture.

This is what the World Bank had desired way back in 1996. It had expected 400 million people to be moved out from rural to urban areas in India by 2015. Since every World Bank loan comes with 140-150 conditionalities, each loan re-emphasised the urgency to move farmers out of agriculture. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had time and again expressed the need to shift 70 per cent farmers to urban areas. Former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan used to say that the biggest reforms would be when farmers are moved out of agriculture, to meet the ever-growing demand of cheaper labour for the infrastructure industry. The National Skill Development Council already has spelled out plans to bring down the population in farming from the existing 52 per cent to 38 per cent by 2022.

Small wonder then debt and farming have now become synonymous. Seventy years after Independence and 51 years after the Green Revolution was launched, economic freedom continues to elude farmers. Economic Survey 2016 made it abundantly clear. According to the survey report, the average income of a farming family in 17 states does not exceed Rs 20,000 a year. In other words, farming families in roughly half the country are surviving on less than Rs 1,700 a month. Knowing that the amount is highly insufficient to even rear a cow, I shudder to think how these families manage to survive year after year!

It is believed that expanding irrigation and improving crop productivity are the ways to enhance farmers’ income. If irrigation and high productivity alone could raise farmers’ income, I see no reason why Punjab has lately turned into a suicide hotspot. Almost 98 per cent of the cultivable area in the state is under assured irrigation. With wheat productivity of 4,500 kg per hectare and rice productivity of 6,000 kg per hectare, agricultural output of Punjab tops the global list. Yet, the state is witness to a spate of farmer suicides every week, and planners have refrained from looking beyond raising crop productivity as the answer to the worsening agrarian crisis.

I am of the firm opinion that a tinkering here and there is not going to alleviate the situation. It needs a holistic approach, a paradigm shift in economic thinking. To begin with, the effort should be to make farming economically viable. After all, everything boils down to the net income of the farmer. And, here are a few steps that immediately need to be considered:

CACP should be directed to factor in four allowances while working out MSP—housing allowance, medical allowance, education allowance and travel allowance. As of now, MSP covers only the production cost. Now, compare this with the government employees who get a total of 108 allowances.



Since MSP benefits only 6 per cent of farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50 per cent profit over MSP will benefit only these 6 per cent farmers. For the remaining 94 per cent farmers, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to redesign the CACP into a Commission for Farmers Income and Welfare, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 to a farmer’s family.



Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing agricultural produce market committee (APMC) mandis and for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is to set up 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.

798685,"Farmers’ agitation sees nearly Rs 600-crore loss in toll collections in states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR; Rs. 9300-crore of debt at risk: ICRA","Share this

29 January 2021, New Delhi: ICRA Ratings has said that around 52 toll plazas [includes both public funded and BOT (built, operate and transfer)] for national highways (NHs) operated in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR have been directly or indirectly affected due to farmers protests. Apart from this, the revenue loss in the State Highways Projects in these regions will be an additional burden. On September 27, 2020, the three Farm Acts† were passed in the Parliament. These acts have been facing strong protests from the farmers of Haryana and Punjab since June 2020 and have intensified from October 1, 2020 onwards, with rail and road network obstructed majorly in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR.

Also Read: Rural demand seen ebbing in 2021-22, but urban consumption to rise: Report

While the impact on fee collection at some of the toll plazas has begun from October 2020 onwards; however, this has intensified to no fee collection (free movement of vehicles) at all toll plazas in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi-NCR since December 12, 2020. Shedding more light on the impact on toll collections, Mr. Rajeshwar Burla, Vice President, Corporate Ratings, ICRA, said, “The average toll collection per day at these plazas is estimated at Rs. 7 crore. Until January 26, 2021, these national highway toll plazas would have incurred an estimated revenue loss of around Rs. 560 crore out of which ~Rs. 410 crore is estimated for BOT Concessionaires. Out of the Rs. 9,300-crore of impacted rated debt, ~Rs. 8550-crore of debt is at a high risk of default while Rs. 750 crore is rated as investment grade with low to moderate risk of default. Some of these entities also have debt service reserves (DSRAs) of around three months in place to use for such exigencies; however, this would have been completely used up by now.”

The inability to collect toll for a continuous period of 24 hours and exceeding an aggregate period of seven days in an accounting year due to agitations/ strikes would be considered an indirect political event under the force majeure clause. In such cases, with the costs attributable to such events, beyond the insurance cover, one half of such excess amount is likely to be reimbursed by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), covering around 25% of the loss of revenue incurred by the affected projects. As per ICRA estimates, this would amount to around Rs.100 crore until January 26, 2021. Further, the concession period shall be extended in proportion to the loss of fee on a daily basis.

As for the impact on the ratings for ICRA-rated BOT (Toll) road portfolio, three entities have been impacted by the farmer protests, out of which two had been rated in the default category even before the farm protests, while the third (rated [ICRA]BBB-(Stable)) has support from a stronger parent. “The performance of toll road projects has remained subpar in Q1 FY2021 due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. While the toll collections witnessed a marked improvement starting Q2 FY2021; with this farmer agitation, the toll road projects in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi-NCR region are expected to be impacted severely, resulting in a steep decline of around 30-35% in toll collections in FY2021 (when compared to 5-7% decline for rest of India), assuming that the protests would subside by February 2021,”",0
798756,Lumpy skin disease epidemic in Saurashtra; 39 animals dead: Govt,"Government takes measures to control epidemic spread in animals; over 25,000 cattle vaccinated across affected areas

Some 1,229 cattle across five districts of Gujarat have been infected with Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD), an infectious viral disease, in the past one month. Some 39 of the animals have died, according to data shared by district Panchayats with the state’s animal husbandry department recently.

Six cows have died in Kutch district, eight in Jamnagar, 21 in Dwarka and four in Porbandar, according to the data.

Read Down To Earth’s coverage of lumpy skin disease

The LSD epidemic started in Dwarka and Jamnagar districts. They are also the worst-hit.

One of the oldest cattle shelters in Dwarka is the Dwarka Gaushala, which is 135 years old and had almost 70 cows till recently.

“Half of the 70 were infected. Five died. The others have been treated and have shown improvement and have started eating. LSD-infected cows stop eating. They experience tiredness and tears flow continuously from their eyes,” Paresh Jhakharia, a volunteer at Dwarka Gaushala, told this reporter.

Symptoms of LSD primarily consist of fever, fluid excretion from eyes and nose, dribbling of saliva from the mouth and blisters on the body. The animal stops eating and faces problems while chewing or eating, resulting in reduced milk production. If an animal is pregnant, the calf dies.

Treating LSD

The administration has taken steps to rein in the epidemic. The data pointers shared by the animal husbandry department said preventive measures such as isolation and treatment of affected animals, vaccination, vector control on the premises and awareness were being taken.

“We had conducted a telemedicine session for a cow shelter in Kutch, where veterinary doctors from Karnataka and Odisha were consulted. They who advised us to prepare an Ayurvedic paste and apply it on infected cows along with administration of allopathic medicines,” Vallabh Kathiria, ex-president of the National Kamdhenu Commission and current member of the Lok Sabha from Rajkot constituency, said.

Kathiria visited a cow shelter in Kutch, where 1,000 cows are kept. He said, “There were some 12-15 cows, which had symptoms of LSD and were kept in isolation. Hence, the spread of the disease was not as intense as in other districts.”

He added that vaccines were the only cure to an LSD epidemic. Hence, substantial measures to vaccinate cattle were being taken.

Government records showed that 25,305 cows had been vaccinated till June 9, 2022.

“A vaccination drive is being carried out in a five kilometre radius across infected areas across Gujarat, in accordance with central guidelines,” a senior official from the animal husbandry said on the condition of anonymity.

Citizens are helping out too. Chaitanya Bhateliya, a local resident, gave details about LSD to residents. He also informed the authorities, whenever an infected animal died.

“Things are improving. Citizens have become vigilant. They immediately inform the authorities whenever they see an infected animal,” Bhateliya said.

“Procurement of cow milk has not been affected due to the LSD epidemic, as the impact in terms of percentage or numbers of cattle affected is not big and timely measures have helped stem the epidemic,” a senior official from the Rajkot-headquartered Mahi Milk Producer Co Ltd, said.",0
798934,Lumpy skin disease: The deadly pandemic that has taken root among India’s bovines,"This will have a devastating impact on the country, where most dairy farmers are either landless or marginal landholders and milk is among the cheapest protein source

A strange but familiar fear has prevailed over the village of Kammana in Kerala’s Wayanad district since the beginning of the year. It was much like what the residents experienced around the same time last year, when the state reported India’s first novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case. This time the virus is different and so is the host, but the disease is equally contagious, unknown, stealthy and debilitating.

“I don’t know how and when three of my five Jersey cows contracted the disease,” says Saji Joseph, a resident of Kammana. All of a sudden, in the first week of January, lumps started appearing on their body accompanied by high fever.

Within a week, they have become emaciated, says Joseph, adding that he loses Rs 700 a day because of reduced milk yield. In this village of mostly dairy farmers, 200 other households face the same predicament. Even infected bulls and buffaloes are unable to pull carts or perform farm activities.

Local veterinarians have identified it as lumpy skin disease (LSD), a viral illness that causes prolonged morbidity in cattle and buffaloes. It appears as nodules of two to five centimetre diameter all over the body, particularly around the head, neck, limbs, udder and genitals.

The lumps gradually open up like large and deep wounds. In some cases — under 10 per cent according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) — the infected animal succumbs to the disease.

While the LSD virus easily spreads by blood-sucking insects like mosquitoes, flies and ticks and through saliva and contaminated water and food, veterinarians say no treatment is available for the disease, that is being reported for the first time in India.

Historically, LSD has remained confined to Africa, where it was first discovered in 1929, and parts of West Asia. But in recent years, the disease has spread to territories beyond the endemic areas. In 2015, it made an incursion into the European part of Turkey and Greece.

The next year, it created havoc in the Balkan and Caucasian countries and Russia. However, since its arrival in Bangladesh in July 2019, LSD is spreading across Asia in epidemic proportions.

According to a risk assessment report by FAO, the disease spread to seven countries till the end of 2020 — reaching China and India in August 2019, Nepal in June 2020, Taiwan in July 2020, Bhutan and Vietnam in October 2020 and Hong Kong in November 2020.

At least 23 countries in south Asia, east Asia and southeast Asia are now at risk of LSD, which is emerging as a trans-boundary animal disease, it says.

In India, which has the world’s highest 303 million heads of cattle, the disease has spread to 15 states within just 16 months. In fact, in August 2019, when the first outbreak of LSD was reported from Odisha, five districts were grappling with the exotic cattle pox.

Worse, studies suggest the virus could have already mutated in the country. Vandana Gupta, assistant professor at the College of Veterinary Science Animal Husbandry, Jabalpur, who is studying gene sequences of the samples collected from infected cattle in Madhya Pradesh, has found that the strain is different from the one isolated in Odisha during the first outbreak.

“We need an urgent prevention strategy. The disease might behave differently here than how it behaves in other countries. Since LSD virus is related to sheep and goat pox, we need to understand whether it can transmit to sheep and goats as well,” she warns.

Unclear transmission

Due to the infectious nature of LSD and its implications on the economy — decreased milk production, abortions and infertility and damaged hides due to cutaneous nodules and fibrous tissue growth cause significant economic losses to farmers — the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) declares it as a notifiable disease.

This means a country must inform OIE about any outbreak of the disease so that it can be contained. Yet, no consolidated figure is available with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD) regarding the actual spread of LSD in the country or economic losses incurred by farmers.

Unofficial estimates show at least 5,000 heads of cattle might have contracted LSD in Kerala alone since December 2019. When contacted by Down To Earth (DTE) Vijay Kumar, in-charge of livestock health at DAHD, said, “Total confirmed real positive cases are 30 to 40 per affected state. Since it resembles other skin diseases, people confuse those with lumpy skin disease.”

Satyajit Doley, a young cattle farmer from Dhansiri Mukh, a village on the eastern fringe of the Kaziranga National Park in Assam, is testament to this lackadaisical attitude of the authorities towards LSD.

Doley first observed round and stiff lumps on the front legs of his cows when the waters from the first cycle of flood receded during the monsoon last year — almost a year after cases started erupting in India as well as in Bangladesh, its neighbour across the border.

Within a fortnight, four other cows showed similar symptoms with mild fever and almost negligible production of milk. By that time, the next cycle of floods had hit the state. Doley, who lives on the floodplains of the Dhansiri river that meets the Brahmaputra three kilometres (km) downstream, had to evacuate.

“But we could not get the animals to move who then probably drowned in the flood waters.” Soon, it spread to 100-odd cows in the neighbourhood. Doley and several others in his village notified the local government veterinary department but in vain. The authorities sprang into action much later only when the state government sounded an alarm about LSD affecting livestock across the state, Doley alleges.

Some states like Kerala have, however, been taking proactive measures to contain the spread of LSD. The state’s Dairy Development Minister K Raju tells DTE that the government has ensured frequent health check-ups of cattle in all districts and are concentrating on eradication of the disease.

Veterinary hospitals have been directed to provide all the treatments for free. However, he says, the challenge is no specific vaccine against LSD is available in India. Right now, the veterinanrians are following the protocols they would follow in case of a pandemic.

In Kammana, they have asked Joseph and other dairy farmers to spray disinfectants in cattle-sheds several times a day to eradicate flies and mosquitoes that act as vectors of LSD. In case of death of an animal, farmers have been advised to bury the carcass deep inside the earth. But more than that, they have been advised to quarantine the cattle even at the slightest symptom of the disease.

Will this help?

Tracing the source of infection plays a critical role in containing the spread of any contagious infection. But the authorities are still cluless about how LSD was introduced to India.

“We are not sure of the origin of the disease in India,” says Praveen Malik, animal husbandry commissioner at DAHD. “It has probably happened through mechanical transmission via vectors across the border or through illegal imports of cattle. Some vectors can fly a long distance riding on the air current or can spread through contaminated equipment or syringes. We have requested the National Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics to conduct a study of all factors that contribute to the spread of the disease,” says Malik.

FAO, in its risk assessment report, however, states the long porous borders between India, Nepal and Bangladesh allow for a significant amount of bilateral and informal animal trade, including cattle and buffaloes.

This may have favoured the spread of LSD in July-August 2019 between Bangladesh and India. Though Bangladesh has no formal cross-border trade with India, a value chain study by FAO notes: “Given the gap between supply and demand for animal protein in Bangladesh and disparities in livestock prices with India, unofficial imports of livestock including cattle and buffaloes to meet animal protein demand have been observed. The flow of informal cross-border movements of cattle from India to districts of Nepal, especially those bordering Bihar, usually by foot, likely led to the spread of the infection there.”

Whatever the reason may be, analysts say eradicating the disease from India may not be easy.

As of now, several states have authorised the use of goat pox vaccine for treating LSD as the virus is antigenically similar to sheep and goat pox. It needs to be administered on all cattle within 5 km zone of the epicentre.

But a veterinarian based in Kannur in north Kerala tells DTE on the condition of anonymity that they have received “only 3,000 vaccines” against the demand of 7,000 units. Kumar says vaccination and treatment are secondary measures.

“We have issued advisories to states to follow biosecurity measures, putting checkposts on borders for interstate movement, and isolation.” But such protocols are barely followed in a country where livestock is mostly raised by landless or marginal farmers and under backyard systems.

In Thakpali village of the tribal-dominated Malkangiri district of Odisha, the residents allege that their cattle might have contracted the disease from herds that travel through their villages.

Every month traders from Chhattisgarh transport 8,000 to 10,000 heads of cattle to Andhra Pradesh via Kalahandi and Malkangiri. No one monitors the trading, let alone the health of the cattle, they say.

Malik admits that stray cattle could be a major reason for the spread because there is no supportive or symptomatic treatment for them nor does anybody apply fly repellents on them.

The 20th Livestock Census, done in 2019, shows the population of stray cattle has increased in 20 states since the previous 2012 census. “The state government will have to come up with a solution to address the issue. We will support them if they require any technical or funding assistance,” he adds.

Unless eradicated on a war footing, changing climate and poor animal healthcare infrastructure will act in favour of LSD.

“The disease can be checked if the animal is treated within the initial few days. But most of the times, people do not give importance to skin diseases in cattle. They think it will heal naturally. At places where farmers are aware, veterinary service is either not available or not affordable,” says P Selvaraj, professor, Tamil Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Chennai.

Insects like ticks, biting flies, mosquitoes are anyway more prevalent in tropical climatic conditions of India. As unseasonal rains and floods become frequent, they will provide a conducive atmosphere for insect growth and multiplication and infectious disease vectors will no longer be restricted to a few months, he adds.

This will have a devastating impact on the country, where most dairy farmers are either landless or marginal landholders and milk is among the cheapest protein source.",0
796752,Fall Armyworm attack: The damage done,"By the time the infestation was detected, it had already become malignant. Khemo Baghel, a farmer of Bade Chakwa village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district, took up maize cultivation for the first time early this year. He dug a borewell and was convinced that the return from maize would be better than any other crop. But hardly had the seeds sprouted, he saw some keedas (worms) slowly colonising his farm. “I detected them one morning. There was no trace of them the previous day. I think they landed at night,” he narrates. Within two months, the keedas had a firm grip on his farm, taking away 30 per cent of his maize crop.

Uncertainty hovers over the village as other maize farmers report the presence of this hitherto-unseen insect. Now agriculture scientists and extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa and neighbouring villages and they too are puzzled. But by now, the outlier has a local name: “American keeda”.

In January 2019, Chhattisgarh became the latest state to report the infestation of Fall Armyworm (FAW). As Down To Earth (DTE) reporter travelled across Bastar, a district ravaged by the decades old bloodbath between the Maoists and the security forces, the insect emerged as the focal point of most conversations. In Palari village, the American keeda has damaged the entire maize crop. “I have been farming for four to five years, but have never noticed this insect. Pesticides are not effective on them,” says Parmeshwar Pandey.

In just nine months since FAW was spotted in India in Karnataka last June, it has invaded crops in over 10 states. As if taking a pre-scripted route, FAW infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states; then to western Maharashtra and Gujarat; and now to eastern states. Besides advancing fast, the pest is also attacking new crops. Though it is being detected mostly in maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates it has affected nearly 170,000 hectares (ha) of maize crops—there have been reports from states where it has infested paddy, sugarcane and sweet corn. Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. It accounts for 9 per cent of the total food grain production in the country.



First sighting



Entomologists CM Kalleshwara Swamy and Sharanabasappa first detected FAW in the research fields of maize at the University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences, Shimoga, Karnataka. Just before the monsoon last year, a few maize farmers from Chikballapur district of the state reported a pest infestation to A N Shylesha, scientist at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR). Shylesha took it to be the True Armyworm infestation. But the severity in the infestation led him and his colleague SK Jalali to conduct a survey of the affected fields and collect samples in July 2018. At the end of the month came the confirmation, and a challenge in the form of the country staring at its first FAW infestation. The Fall Armyworm or Spodoptera frugiperda is more dangerous than the True Armyworm.





A sojourn out of its native



The up to 2-cm long pest “accidentally” landed in Africa in 2016 from the Americas, almost after 100 years. Since then, it has spread to over 50 countries in Africa and Asia ravaging crops, especially maize. In 2018, it invaded Asia through Yemen and India and has now spread to Bangladesh, Myanmar, Nepal and China (see 'At war'). A rapid breeder, the insect is known to eat 300 species of plants, most of which are major food crops. It has diversified its diet and can survive harsh conditions by migrating to different places or hiding, to spring back when conditions are favourable. Its wide dietary platter along with its phenomenal spread across two continents in just the last two years has made FAW an agent of global food production crisis.



In Andhra Pradesh’s Institute of Frontier Technology — an affiliate of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) in Tirupati — crop researchers are a worried lot as the news of infestation has turned from a trickle to a deluge. It was first identified in Andhra Pradesh in August 2018 when it affected maize growing areas of East and West Godavari districts, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. “With maize seed production being a major crop in Godavari district, it can have serious economic consequences. Being a major ingredient for the poultry and cattle feed, production losses in maize could cripple meat and milk production,” says M John Sudheer, principal scientist at ANGRAU.



Their immediate concern is whether the pest would start attacking millets and cereals like bajra, jowar, ragi and others. “The lifecycle of the worm can range from 30 to 45 days. In winter, the cycle can extend up to even 90 days. With continuous overlapping generations the worm can be seen in all stages at the same time. This makes it difficult to manage the pest,” says Sudheer.



K Bhupathi Reddy, a maize farmer in Mallayapalli near Tirupati in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, always treated maize as a farmer-friendly crop. The investment is low and there is a ready market for the crop. After selling the maize, the fodder (45-50 tonnes per ha) can fetch Rs 2,000 per tonne from nearby cow shelters. “I have already spent Rs 20,000 for controlling these pests this season,” he says, adding that it is still not sufficient. Agriculture officials suggested crop rotation. But the infestation has jumped to other crops as well.



In Tamil Nadu, FAW has been confirmed in sugarcane crops in two districts, a first for the country. “Our entomologists visited Erode and Karur districts and have confirmed the presence of Spodopetra frugiperda. They also assessed the levels of damage to crop,” Bakshi Ram, director of the Coimbatore-based ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, stated in his letter to the State Directorate of Agriculture in December 2018. Speaking to DTE, Ram says, “Our team found FAW in four fields of the two districts. The infestation is not very serious and can be managed if farmers are made aware.”



In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, FAW has infested crops in 13 out of the 52 districts. The worst affected are the agriculturally prosperous regions of Malwa, Mahakoshal and Baghelkhand. DTE reporter spoke to over 30 farmers over phone to gauge the extent of the damage. While all the farmers said that FAW is rapidly spreading, the state is yet to ascertain the scale of crop damage. Agriculture officials at the Krishi Vikas Kendras, however, confirm a gradual increase in the number of farmers reporting infestation in maize and soyabean crops.





Branching out

Malvika Chaudhary from the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI) says, “Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are currently witnessing greater infestation. But taking into account environmental conditions and availability of host species the eastern side of India is more vulnerable to the pest in the near future.” Her forecast is already showing signs of coming true. During kharif 2018, the central government sent an alert to the agriculture department in Odisha saying that maize cultivation in some states had been attacked by FAW and the department needed to undertake a survey in maize-growing districts in the state. The Odisha government formed a committee under the chairmanship of agriculture director M Muthukumar to check the worm's spread. “The committee has taken a decision to regularly monitor and supervise the maize growing districts of the state and to create awareness among field level officials and farmers about the pest,” says Muthukumar.

In Maharashtra, FAW was first detected on August 29, 2018, in a maize field at Tandulwadi village in Solapur district by farmer Ganesh Babar. “Today, six months later, the infestation has spread across Maharashtra in Vidarbha, Marathwada and especially in western Maharashtra,” says Ankush Chormule, agronomist and entomologist of the 6th Grain Corporation. “In close to 15 districts of Maharashtra surveyed by the 6th Grain Corporation, the presence of the worm has been confirmed,” he adds.

“In India, FAW has already damaged crops in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. The damage caused by FAW is colossal as it has 30 to 40 days life cycle and one moth can lay up to 1,000 eggs at one time. The FAW larva scrapes out leaves causing a lot of damage to the crop,” says Chormule.

It is a double whammy for farmers. For one, there is a surge in expenditure and concurrently, there is a distinct fall in the crop yield. Babar, for instance, has suffered a 10 per cent loss in profit in the last year—translating into a production loss of 0.5 to 0.75 tonne per ha. Owing to this damage caused by the worm and the concurrent dearth, maize that earlier sold at Rs 12,000 per tonne is now being sold almost at Rs 19,000 per tonne. The yield has dipped drastically owing to drought and infestation. This is expected to continue, or get worse in 2019. As a result, India will have to increase the import of maize. The shift to imports in the world’s seventh largest maize producer, which typically exports to Asia, highlights the breadth of the crop losses due to FAW.

In Telangana, it is an unheard of situation. Though it is one of India’s traditionally non-maize areas, to earn more in face of drought farmers switched to maize in a big way: 0.5 million ha are under this crop. It is also covered under the government’s minimum support price (MSP) regime. FAW has infested maize crops in all the districts. Mora Sudarshan Patel of Kuntala village in Nirmal district has destroyed 0.8 ha of his maize crops while Kadam Avadhuta Rao of Penchikalapadu village destroyed crop in 1.2 ha to arrest FAW infestation. “Once we reaped good harvest of chili. Vagaries of market played havoc with us. We adopted maize which looked promising. FAW has upset the precarious economy of small and marginal farmers,” says Patel.

The situation in Nizambad district is worse. The farmers here have been on warpath demanding MSP for red jowar and turmeric—a replacement crop for maize lost to FAW. At the time of writing of this article on February 16, thousands of farmers from Armoor and Nizambad division laid siege to National Highway 44 demanding procurement of red jowar and turmeric by the government. Aleti Naveen Reddy of Mantena village, who also took part in the agitation, is planning a fast unto death to put pressure on the state government to deliver the promise it made at the time of the Assembly elections.

What is alarming is that FAW has started hopping to other crops as well. The DNA bar-coding test of 44 samples collected from as many as eight districts has conf irmed that paddy (Karimnagar), chickpea (Adilabad), jowar (Vikarabad) and groundnut (Nagarkurnool) are under attack.

C Parthasarathi, principal secretary, agriculture says that the maize crop damage was observed in about 15 districts. During rabi season 2018-19, the incidence of pest ranged from 5 per cent to 45 per cent. “FAW was noticed in maize in extent of 17,394 ha out of 462,322 ha actual sown area in kharif 2018. During rabi 2018-19 the pest was noticed in 22,072 ha out of 78,982 ha of actual sown area,” Parthasarathi informs. Though the extent of crop loss is not available officially, Ramanjaneyulu, scientist and director, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, who studied the pest extensively, from the economic perspective, puts the loss at 30 per cent in kharif. “Prolonged monoculture, supported by powerful pesticides have destroyed the natural enemies of the pest. Long dry spells coupled with too many bouts of overcast sky have made maize susceptible to pest attack. Enough is enough, the government should encourage farmers to migrate to pulses and oil seeds before it is too late,” Ramanjaneyulu says.

Parthasarathi says the foreign pest has thrown up a challenge before the scientific community. “The pest behaviour varies from region to region and season to season. The scientists should study the behaviour of the pest in different environments and come up with a forecast for every season,” he says, forewarning that the outbreak of FAW might not confine to maize alone and it could invade other crops as well once the maize harvest is completed. “The ball now is in the court of agricultural scientists,” he says.





Small farmers are the most vulnerable

Tackling the moth is vital for food security and livelihood needs



The arrival of FAW in India has made it clear that the pest will cause destruction globally. Just two years after it entered Africa, the pest reached its second continent—Asia. It will now enter other Asian countries including China, the second largest maize-producing country. “FAW could have a devastating impact on Asia's maize and rice producers—mostly small-scale farmers who depend on their crops for food and to make a living. This is a threat that we cannot ignore,” says Kundhavi Kadiresan, FAO assistant director- general and regional representative for Asia and the Pacific. Maize is a staple crop essential for food security in large parts of Asia and Africa. In early 2016, strains of FAW were first spotted in Nigeria, after the moth probably crossed the Atlantic in cargo containers or airplane holds before being dispersed by the wind, a 2017 report, Fall Armyworm: Impacts and Implications for Africa, by the Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI) says. Now, the pest has spread to 44 African and six Asian countries.



Trail of destruction

Even before FAW ravaged maize fields in Africa, COOPROMASA—a maize farmers’ cooperative in eastern Rwanda—had warned of a major pest attack. In 2015, tentatively a year before the pest officially arrived, the cooperative’s officials found that the production of maize had reduced from 4 tonnes per ha to 3 tonnes per ha. Two years later, the moth was identified at Mushishito Marshland in Nyamagabe district of Rwanda. Due to limited research and the absence of early detection, it spread quickly. By the end of April 2017, outbreak was reported in all 30 districts where the pest had infested an estimated 40 per cent of maize crops.

Farmers need to worry as the female moth lays between 1,000 and 2,000 eggs on crop leaves that give birth to destructive caterpillars. Rwanda’s agriculture minister Geraldine Mukeshimana says that the pest still poses a threat to farmers, though many have learnt to deal with it. One of the ways is to destroy the caterpillars by hand. Spraying on infested crops is another measure. But it is expensive. Farmer John Muvara from Nyagatare district of Rwanda applied pesticides on 12 ha of maize which cost him over $1,100. In March 2018, the government, along with FAO, launched a campaign to install pheromone traps to lure and catch the male moths to control their population.

Kenya also took measures to contain the pest. In December 2017, government authorities at Embu, located 120 km northeast of Nairobi, hired men to manually kill the caterpillars. FAO also partnered with the government in a pilot project to try out new control methods. None of the measures, however, proved effective. Overall, 43 of the 47 counties reported the presence of the moth. The country lost up to 20 per cent of its projected maize yields, equivalent to 7.5 to 8 million bags of grains. This was enough to feed the citizens for two long months.

In Ethiopia, more than 0.6 million ha of maize was damaged last year. Uganda was infested too. By mid-2017, the worm was present in all its 127 districts, causing 15 to 75 per cent crop loss. An estimated 450,000 million tonnes of maize worth $192 million was hit.



Weather determing factor

Though a major threat, the moth needs conducive weather conditions to survive. It cannot tolerate extreme temperatures or excess rainfall. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Lesotho has been saved due to cold temperatures. The pest cannot resist Sahara's heat either. Kenya got respite by the onset of heavy rains in March 2018. “The rains seemed to have broken the lifecycle of the moth, which usually attacks crops during its larval stage,” Miltone Ayieko, director, Tegemeo Institute of Agricultural Policy and Development, a research think-tank of Egerton University in Kenya, told Down To Earth.

According to FAO, the worm feeds on 80 crop species. But it seems to thrive on maize. Stephen Mugo, principal scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre’s Africa unit in Nairobi, explains that regions in the north eastern part of Kenya and neighbouring Somalia and Ethiopia, which do not grow maize, did not report the pest.

Tackling FAW infestation is vital for food security in Africa. In SSA, a region already ravaged by drought and food shortage, the larvae attack can leave 300 million people hungry, warns Bukar Tijani, FAO assistant director-general and regional representative for Africa. To prevent the moth from spreading to northern Africa, southern Europe and the Near East, a massive campaign is needed to train over 0.5 million farmers in pest management in SSA.

If farmers' yields dip, it would result in deficit of 16 million tonnes of maize, worth nearly $5 billion. CABI says that in the absence of proper control methods, the moth has the potential to cause yield losses between 8.3 and 20.6 million tonnes per year in 12 of Africa’s major maize-producing countries.

Anatomy of the worm

The pest's ability to adapt and the changing local weather are emerging as two important aspects requiring microscopic research



In the initial reports from Karnataka the cobs were not infested but in later stages the cobs were also infested by the larvae. The adult moths also feed on the plants. “FAW moths are nocturnal in habit. They gather together in large numbers like an army and go to cultivated fields and cut the stems and feed on the leaves. They also completely defoliate (make leafless) the fields so only the veins remain after the infestation. This also leads to rotting of the produce as it gets infected by other fungus,” says AK Chakravarthy, former head of entomology at the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR).

Two characteristics make it a dangerous pest. First is its ability to spread quickly over vast areas. Some scientists have speculated that it might have travelled to India with the monsoon winds from Africa. The adult moth is a fast flyer and can cover 100 km a night and winds are not an impediment. But it’s not possible that the insect could have flown the distance of roughly 7,000 km between South America and Africa. It might have spread because of the entry of contaminated cargo in Nigeria from America. Now experts like Shylesha’s team at the NBAIR are conducting molecular DNA analysis to ascertain how exactly it got here. This study will also inform about the strain of the worm that has entered India.

In Africa there are two strains — one that mostly affects maize and the second that mostly affects rice. As of now the Indian strain has not been identified but this brings us to another looming and major threat. As it travels into new climates and geographies, FAW might be slowly modifying itself genetically, though it has not been confirmed as yet. Shylesha says that we need more research to find out if the species is indeed diversifying. ""The initial assessment will take another two-three months while the complete analysis might take more than a year,"" he says.

The second reason that makes FAW dangerous is its reproductive capacity. A single female can lay 600 to 700 eggs. Under African conditions a female is known to lay 1,600 eggs. The number of eggs increases when there are alternate hosts, which is now the case in India. Warm and humid conditions also help its reproductive capabilities. Temperatures ranging from 15 to 300° Celsius are optimum for egg laying, growth and spread. Extreme temperatures, either hot or cold, are not favourable for the pest but this is where it acts to protect itself. During the harsh winters in northern United States the moths travel down south to warmer states like Texas and Florida and return when the conditions become congenial.

From the initial infestation of maize, the moth has spread to sugarcane, sorghum, different varieties of millets and its diet might further increase as it spreads. The biggest scare is its infestation of rice and unconfirmed reports of that happening have been received by digital platforms like the Plantix app operated by Germany-based artificial intelligence and agriculture start up, Progressive Environmental and Agricultural Technologies (PEAT). The type and extent of infestation depends on the stage or the age of the crop.

“FAW is capable of eating very heavily, more than its body weight. It is also a polyphagous pest, which means that it can feed on more than one species of plants and also diverse species of plants. This is because they have been able to incorporate and digest multiple nutrients and chemical compounds,” explains Chakravarthy. He adds that all monocot plants which have only one embryonic leaf or cotyledon are at risk of infestation. Most food grain crops like maize, rice and millets and other economically important crops like sugarcane are monocots.

Climate change might also be playing a role in the increased risk from FAW. “Under the global warming scenario in India FAW is going to feed more. This will lead to more generations of the insect and early completion of its lifecycle,” says Chakravarthy. The pertinent question is if this notorious pest can be brought under control? Experts feel that this can be done through early detection and subsequent pest management. The Plantix app is helping out farmers all over India with the early detection part. The app gets its inputs from the farmers through photographs of the infestation from the field. Then it uses image recognition and analysis carried out by an artificial intelligence machine to identify the pest correctly. It tells the farmer if the pest that she is looking at is FAW or not. And even if it is not able to give this exact information it gives a list of possible pests which then can be confirmed by a local expert. “Around 6,500 farmers have approached us with photographs through the app and in 90 per cent of the cases we have been able to inform them correctly about the pest,” says Korbinian Hartberger, co-founder of PEAT.

“Wherever FAW infestation is very severe we are recommending the use of Emamectin Benzoate (0.4 grams per litre of water). Where it is mild we are recommending neem formulations. Apart from these we are asking farmers not to use any other chemicals. If timely management practices are initiated, the pest can be controlled, and as of now, in India it has not affected the yield as it did in Africa,” says Shylesha.

301,"Bird flu outbreak in state-run poultry farm in Kerala, 1800 birds dead
","A bird flu outbreak has been reported in a state-run poultry farm in Kozhikode district of Kerala as around 1,800 chickens have died of the infection, official sources said. The presence of H5N1 variant, which has an additional proliferative capacity, was confirmed among the poultry in the local farm managed by the district panchayat here on Wednesday, the sources said.

J Chinchu Rani, Kerala Minister for Animal Husbandry, gave instructions to take urgent preventive measures as per the Centre's guidelines and protocol in this regard, they said.

As initial tests indicated the outbreak of bird flu, the samples were sent to the high security lab in Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) for accurate diagnosis which confirmed the avian influenza, a government statement said.
There were over 5,000 chickens in the farm and of them 1,800 died so far due to the infection.

The culling and other further procedures would be done with the coordination of various government departments under the aegis of the district authorities, it added.

","As many as 4,848 pigs and piglets have died in the outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) since its recurrence from February this year, according to data released by state Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department on Sunday. Thirty-nine pigs died on Sunday due to ASF, the data said.


So far, 4,077 pigs have been culled to prevent further spread of ASF and 11 pigs were culled on Sunday, it said.

The highly contagious pig disease has currently affected 68 villages and localities in nine out of 11 districts of the state, the data said.

Earlier, state Animal Husbandry and Veterinary minister Dr K Beichhua had said that the state government would soon declare the ASF outbreak as a state disaster.

He said farmers, who lost pigs due to ASF will be compensated for their losses once the outbreak is declared a disaster.


The minister had also said that the Centre has already released funds to compensate the culled pigs and assistance would be released once the state government meets its matching share, which is 50 per cent of the fund sanctioned by the Centre.

The outbreak of ASF was first reported at Lungsen village in south Mizoram's Lunglei district near the Bangladesh border on March 21 last year.

As many as 33,417 pigs had died due to the outbreak of ASF last year causing monetary losses to the tune of Rs 60.82 crore.

348,"Lumpy disease: 35,000 cattle killed in 9 states","A total of 35,000 cattle have died due to lumpy skin disease in nine Indian states as of August 23, 2022, according to the Union department of Animal Husbandry. Around 900,000 cattle have been infected, as the department tries to contain any further spread of the disease. 

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral illness, caused by lumpy skin disease virus of the capripoxvirus genus in the poxviridae family. 

It appears as nodules of two-five centimetre diameters all over the body, particularly around the head, neck, limbs, udder and genitals. The lumps gradually open up like large and deep wounds. 

Two main reasons for the spread are the multiplication of vectors like houseflies, ticks as well as mosquitoes during the monsoon months and the unrestricted movement of stray cattle. 

Stray cattle pose a problem because they are difficult to isolate, said regional officer, livestock health, department of animal husbandry and dairying, to Down To Earth (DTE). 

�But now, isolation centres are coming up and the department has issued guidelines for the state governments to liaison with the district administrations or the municipalities to control the stray cattle movement,� he added.

The disease has spread to Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Jammu, with maximum cases reported from Rajasthan and Gujarat. 

There are about 5 million stray cattle in the country, out of which 4 million are in these nine states, according to the Livestock Census 2019. 

In about 10 per cent of the cases, the infected animal succumbs to the disease, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). In India, the mortality rate is 2-3 per cent of the infected cattle, Kumar said. 

The states are reporting more mortality in stray animals, especially in Gujarat and Rajasthan, Animal Husbandry Commissioner Praveen Malik told DTE. He added:

Stray cattle are weaker and have low immunity in general. So, more deaths are being reported, especially from drought-prone regions in Gujarat and Rajasthan.

The virus mainly spreads through blood-sucking vectors, which multiply during the rains, and the authorities are hoping the spread will be contained once the monsoon season is over. 

Currently, 5 million healthy animals in these nine states have been vaccinated with goat pox vaccine to prevent the spread of the disease and the department is targeting 900,000-1 million more animals in the coming days. 

The priority is doing ring vaccination in the 5-kilometre radius of the outbreak, especially in border areas of different states so that it doesn�t spread to more states, said Kumar.

�There are certain limitations in vaccines. They are not even available globally. But in India, there are two companies making the vaccine and we have asked them to increase the production,� said Kumar. 

Goat pox vaccine is tried and tested in the country as the virus is antigenically similar to sheep and goat pox, Kumar added. �There is an LSD vaccine also but it has been observed that it is not safe and effective as it leads to new strains. The results of the goat pox vaccine are better.�

Historically, LSD has remained confined to Africa, where it was first discovered in 1929, and parts of West Asia. But in recent years, the disease has spread to territories beyond the endemic areas. In 2015, it made an incursion into the European part of Turkey and Greece.

The next year, it wreaked havoc in the Balkan and Caucasian countries and Russia. However, since its arrival in Bangladesh in July 2019, LSD is spreading across Asia in epidemic proportions.

The disease spread to seven countries till the end of 2020 � reaching China and India in August 2019, Nepal in June 2020, Taiwan in July 2020, Bhutan and Vietnam in October 2020 and Hong Kong in November 2020, according to a risk assessment report by FAO. 

At least 23 countries in south, east and southeast Asia are now at risk of LSD. India has the world�s highest number of cattle (303 million).",0
351,Explained: The lumpy skin disease affecting cows in Rajasthan,"Hundreds of cows infected with the lumpy skin disease have been dying in Rajasthan for the past couple of months.

According to several media reports, the highly contagious disease that can affect cows and buffaloes has been spreading like COVID for two months.

The rapid spread of the disease has put the Animal Husbandry Department on high alert since the death of the cows is directly affecting milk production, the brunt of which is faced by cattle herders.

The disease has spread in Jaisalmer, Barmer, Jalore, Pali, Jodhpur and Bikaner districts.

Here�s what you need to know about the deadly lumpy skin disease.

What is lumpy skin disease?

Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a viral disease that infects cows and buffaloes. Although, the disease has relatively low mortality rate, it can create animal welfare issues and can lead to production losses.

A vector-borne disease, it spreads through insects like certain species of flies, mosquitoes and even ticks. LSD can also spread via contaminated equipment and in some cases through animal-to-animal contact. The disease does not pose a risk to humans.

Symptoms include fever, nodules on the skin that can also lead to death. LSD is more fatal to those animals that haven�t been exposed to the virus before. According to a report by DownToEarth, the lumps gradually open up to expose large and deep wounds. In many cases, the disease can create watery eyes and increase nasal and salivary secretions.

LSD was first discovered in Africa in 1929. For a long time, it remained confined in the country but in recent times LSD has spread beyond the territories of Africa. In 2015, it was found in Turkey and Greece.

How can it be treated?

Vaccination drives in southern European countries have effectively controlled the outbreak of LSD but in other areas the success rate of vaccines has not been impressive. According to Australia�s Department of Agriculture, the complete eradication of the disease is difficult.

As per a report by Business Line, the Gujarat government has recently started vaccinating cattle against LSD.

How has the state government responded?

A number of cattle herders have blamed the Rajasthan government for not taking adequate measures to prevent the spread of the disease, according to Times of India.

The rapid spread of the disease has put the Animal Husbandry Department on high alert since the death of the cows is directly affecting milk production, the brunt of which is faced by cattle herders.

The joint director of the Animal Husbandry Department in Barmer, Dr Ratanlal Jinagar said that the department should issue an advisory for prevention from the disease. Meanwhile, Barmer�s district collector has directed to set up a control room at the district headquarters. All block level local officers have been instructed to conduct surveys in the area.

What are the economic repercussions of the disease?

According to The Arunachal Times, the economic implications of the disease can be severe due to its high morbidity rate. Herders can face significant losses due to infertility in male and female cows, weight loss, drop in milk production and abortions that are the caused by the disease.

Last month, Pakistan met with a serious threat as a result of an outbreak of the disease. According to The Print, more than 570 cows had died in the province of Sindh. The crisis impacted Pakistan�s livestock industry which contributes about 11 per cent of the country�s GDP. This added more pressure to an already faltering economy of Pakistan.

LSD infects cows in Gujarat too

Cattle in the neighbouring state of Gujarat have not been spared by the disease. Thousands of cows have been hit by the lumpy skin disease in Saurashtra and Kutch.

According to a report by Times of India, Kutch is the most affected region followed by Jamnagar and Porbandar districts. Estimates suggest that around 27,000 cows have been infected in Kutch alone in the past month.

Shagun gaushala owner Harish Verma, who belongs to the BJP and holds the post of vice-president in Jamul Municipality, was arrested on Friday.

Chhattisgarh Rajya Gau Sewa Ayog had lodged a police complaint alleging lack of proper facilities and management at his facility. The owners of the two shelters were Verma's relatives, he claimed.

The police Sunday took into custody two office-bearers of Phoolchand guashala and one of Mayuri cow shelter in Bemetara and they were being questioned, an official at Parpodi police station in the district said. The chairpersons of the two gaushalas were absconding, he said.

According to Patel, lack of management and proper facilities at the cow shelters led to the deaths. The cattle from these shelters were being shifted to other shelters, he said.

Meanwhile, an official of the animal husbandry department said teams of senior veterinarians were deployed in these shelters to provide treatment to the ailing animals and for their regular monitoring. In the past two days, 152 cows were provided treatment, he said. Besides, several cows from Shagun gaushala were being shifted in the nearby shelters, the official said.

The shelter was overcrowded as 599 bovines were housed there. Meanwhile, Verma, booked under relevant provisions of the Chhattisgarh Agricultural Cattle Preservation Act 2004, Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 and IPC section 409 (criminal breach of trust), was Saturday produced in a Durg court which remanded him in judicial custody, a police official said.

A group of youth Congress workers Saturday smeared ink on Verma's face when he was being taken to jail from the court, a police official in Durg said. The police later arrested seven youth Congress workers in connection with the incident, he said.",0

Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Gujarat and Andaman and Nicobar Islands have been hit by the outbreak of the disease.Mr Rupala, who was here with a central team to take stock of the disease-affected areas, on Saturday cautioned people against drinking milk of the affected cows and said such animals should be isolated.

""Out of five affected states in the country, Rajasthan is the most affected with 11 districts reporting cases of lumpy skin disease,"" he had told reporters.

The minister said the central and state governments are making serious efforts to prevent the spread of the disease in cattle and will soon be able to control it.

He said the infected animals should be kept separate from healthy animals and the vaccination of healthy animals should be done. Dedicated isolation centres should be set up for this purpose, he said.

He further said goat pox vaccine is completely effective to prevent this disease.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has appealed to donors, social workers, public representatives, personnel and all sections of the society to cooperate financially for the prevention of lumpy skin disease spreading among animals of the state.",0
369,"Lumpy Skin Disease Kills 1,200 Cattle In Rajasthan; Government Takes Action","Jodhpur/Jaipur: The outbreak of the contagious lumpy skin disease has become a bane for thousands of cattle herders in western and northern Rajasthan where nearly 1,200 bovines have perished to the disease which is spreading at an unrelenting speed in the region.
Animal husbandry department officials said that the infection has spread among nearly 25,000 cattle in a span of three months.In Jodhpur district alone, 254 cattle succumbed to the disease in the past two weeks drawing the animal husbandry department's attention.

Considering the serious spread of the infection, the department has mobilised teams of doctors in the affected areas and has advised the cattle herders to keep their cattle isolated to shield them from getting infected.

BJP MLA from Raniwara (Jalore) Narayan Singh Dewal has requested the state government to step up its efforts to contain the spread of the infection.

The animal husbandry department has said that the disease which originated in Africa came to India via Pakistan in April.

�Initially, the infection was there in the border districts like Jaisalmer and Barmer but this has now spread to Jodhpur, Jalore, Nagaur, Bikaner, Hanumangarh and other districts in the region,� Dr Arvind Jaitelay, Deputy Director (Disease Control), Animal Husbandry department, told PTI in Jaipur. ""Our teams are already working in the affected areas.� He said that the disease is mainly affecting cows, particularly the indigenous ones and close to 25,000 bovines have been affected so far.

�Infection is rapidly spreading in cows having low immunity. Because of low immunity, other diseases attack and the animal dies,� he said.He said that there is no treatment or vaccine for lump disease and treatment is given as per symptoms. The primary symptoms are pox on skin, high fever, and a runny nose.

�We have mobilised our teams of veterinarians in the affected villages. They have been camping in the villages and providing treatment to the infected cattle�, said Joint Director (Animal Husbandry)- Jodhpur Sanjay Singhvi.

The disease has also had a severe economic impact.

Areas like Phalodi, Osian, Baap, and Lohawat, among others, in Jodhpur have hundreds of cattle already infected.

Mr Singhvi said that 5-10 per cent of the total population of cattle has so far been infected by the lumpy disease in the district.MLA Narayan Singh Dewal wrote a letter to the animal husbandry minister on Friday and demanded that a special team of doctors and medicines in adequate quantity should be made available to Jalore district in view of the spread of the lumpy skin disease.

He said that more than 60 cows of one cattle rearer in his constituency succumbed to the infection, besides several others grappling with deaths of their cattle from the disease.

Alok Singhal, Secretary of Pathmeda Gaudham in Jalore, said that the condition in villages is pathetic and needs urgent attention from authorities.

""The disease is spreading very fast. Over 100 cattle have died in 50 branches of our gaushala in Jalore"", he said.

Mr Singhal said that villagers are also coming to the Gaushala with their infected cattle in serious condition.

According to him, the disease is infecting only indigenous breeds and spreading fast along them.

As it happens, the enormity of the still unfolding crisis has not been lost on the Centre.

Union minister of state for agriculture Kailash Choudhary said that a team of scientists from the Indian Agriculture Research Institute was sent to study the disease spreading in cows in western Rajasthan and for measures to prevent it.

""According to their advice, necessary steps will be taken by the central government for its treatment,"" he tweeted Friday.

The minister admitted that the disease has been responsible for the deaths of a large number of cows and suffering of hundreds of farmers.

Mr Choudhary, an MP from Barmer, also urged the state government to take necessary action by showing seriousness on this, so that farmers and livestock owners can get relief.",0

The viral disease has been reported in 14 districts where over 37,000 animals have been treated for the ailment and 2.68 lakh vaccinated to prevent its spread, a government release issued on Sunday said quoting the minister.
AD

Since the first case of the disease appeared in the state, a high-level meeting was called to make appropriate arrangements for its control.

As a result, the disease has been stopped from spreading further, Patel said without specifying when the first case had come to light.

Lumpy skin is a viral disease spread by mosquitoes, flies, lice, wasps, by direct contact among the cattle, and through contaminated food and water.

The main symptoms are fever in animals, discharge from eyes and nose, salivation from mouth, soft blisters like nodules all over the body, reduced milk production, difficulty in eating, which sometimes lead to the animal's death, the release said.

The viral disease has been reported in Gujarat's 14 districts -- Kutch, Jamnagar, Devbhumi Dwarka, Rajkot, Porbandar, Morbi, Surendranagar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad, Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Banaskantha and Surat.

""The disease has been observed in 880 villages, with 37,121 animals treated for it,"" Patel said.The diseased animals in the affected villages were immediately isolated and so far more than 2.68 lakh animals have been vaccinated to prevent its spread, he said.

An extensive survey, treatment and vaccination drive has been undertaken involving 152 veterinary officers and 438 livestock inspectors of the animal husbandry department, he said.

An additional 267 outsourced veterinarians and vehicles required for the survey, treatment and vaccination have been added given the special situation, he said.

Over 14,000 families have been economically affected as a result of the pig deaths and the disease has spread to 22 districts, the minister told a press conference here.The African Swine Fever (ASF), which was first detected in the country in Assam in February 2020, affects both domestic and wild pigs.

While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, ASF cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans.

Around 900 pigs have died since January 2022 mainly due to the massive flood this year, the minister said.

""This is a deadly disease and the mortality of pigs is 100 per cent. At present 22 districts of Assam having 72 epicentres are affected by ASF. Since March 2020, 40,482 pigs have died of ASF affecting 14,005 pig farming families,"" Bora said.

The government culled 1,378 pigs spread across 27 epicentres to contain the spread of the disease in the north-eastern state, he added.

In September 2020, former Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal ordered the culling of nearly 12,000 pigs in the ASF-affected areas and asked officials concerned to compensate the owners adequately""We have also launched a compensation scheme for the affected families and the government has so far spent ? 1.48 crore to compensate the farmers whose pigs have been culled,� the minister said.

As per central rules, there is a provision for paying compensation based only on the culling of ASF-affected pigs, Bora said.

He also said that the pigs are culled within three days after the spread of ASF to a particular location and compensation is paid to the farmer within 10 days.

""A high-level committee has been formed to monitor the situation and take adequate measures. As of now, the sale of pork is banned in Tinsukia and Sivasagar districts, having all the epicentres,"" Bora said.

The government has formed 427 rapid response teams and launched an extensive awareness drive to sensitise the pig farmers against the spread of the ASF, he added.The minister also stated that to revive the pig farming sector, a series of programmes had been planned in association with International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), and Office International des Epizooties (OIE).

A pig processing centre with a daily capacity to process 400 pigs was ready at Nazira in Sivasagar district.

However, it could not be inaugurated due to the sudden outbreak of the ASF in the region, the minister said.

The state produced 20.88 tonnes of pork in 2020-21 which meets only 60 per cent of the consumption demand. The rest comes from outside the Northeast region, Bora said.

The pig population in the state is estimated to be around 20 lakh, excluding the wild boars roaming in different forests, he added.",0

798885,At least 40% global crops lost to pests every year: FAO,"Invasive pests cost countries at least $70 billion annually, among main drivers of biodiversity loss

As much as 40 per cent of the world’s agricultural crops are lost to pests each year, according to a recent report.

Invasive pests cost countries at least $70 billion annually and are one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss, according to estimates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).

The report, titled Scientific review of the impact of climate change on plant pests, was prepared by Maria Lodovica from the University of Turin in Italy alongside 10 co-authors. It was published June 2, 2021.

The damage from plant pests leaves millions of people without enough food to eat, according to FAO. It adversely impacts agricultural activities and thereby, the primary source of income for rural poor communities.

Qu Dongyu, Director-General, FAO, said:

“The key findings of this review should alert all of us on how climate change may affect how infectious, distributed and severe pests can become around the world”.

The scientific review analysed 15 plant pests and found that climate change will increase the risk of pests spreading in agricultural and forestry ecosystems, especially in cooler Arctic, boreal, temperate and subtropical regions.

The report noted that a single, unusually warm winter can be enough to assist the establishment of invasive pests.

A few pests such as fall armyworm, which feed on crops like maize, sorghum and millet and Tephritid fruit flies (that damage fruit and other crops) have already spread due to a warmer climate. Others, such as desert locusts (the world’s most destructive migratory pests), are expected to change their migratory routes and geographical distribution because of climate change.

Half of all emerging plant diseases are spread by global travel and trade, which have tripled in volume over the last decade, while weather is the second-most important factor, according to the report. Such movements threaten food security in general.

Keeping plants healthy

The report outlined several recommendations to mitigate the impact of climate change on plant health:

When combating pests and diseases, farmers should adopt and policymakers should encourage the use of environment-friendly methods such as integrated pest management.

Half of all emerging plant diseases are spread through travel and trade. To make trade safe, it is important to implement international plant health standards and norms, such as those developed by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPCC) and FAO. The IPPC is a plant health treaty signed by over 180 countries.

The report also highlighted the need for more research as well as investment in strengthening national plant health systems and structures.

Policymakers and government should ensure their decisions are based on sound preparation and data. Regularly monitoring plants and receiving early warning information about emerging threats, helps governments, agricultural officers and farmers take preventive and adaptive measures to keep plants healthy.

“Preserving plant health is fundamental to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Sustaining plant health is an integral part of our work towards more efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agri-food systems,” said Dongyu.

The scientific review was prepared under the auspices of the Secretariat of the International Plant Protection Convention and was hosted by FAO. It is one of the key initiatives of the International Year of Plant Health, which will come to an end in June this year.

The United Nations declared 2020 as the International Year of Plant Health. The Year was extended until July 1, 2021 due to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.",0
798945,Fungal scab attack can spell doom for Kashmir’s apple growers this year,"Early, intense snowfall in November 2019 & a wet monsoon produced conditions for outbreak; lockdown abated it; farmers blame spurious fungicides too

Kashmir’s apple output may be hit by scab disease this season as a fallout of climatic factors. While the fruits would remain edible, the fungal infection would leave marks, making it tough for farmers to get a good price.

Apple orchard owners across the valley are reporting the fungus (Venturia inaequalis), said Fayaz Ahmad Malik, who leads fruit growers and dealers at the fruit wholesale market in Sopore.

The disease is not unusual, but “I have never seen it so intense in my 35 years in business,” claimed Abdul Jabbar, an orchard owner in Bandipora district. His yield has dropped to 30 boxes this season, way below the normal 150-250.

Haji Khazir Mohammad of similarly told DTE that earlier he would get 5,000 boxes of apples every year from his 40 kanal (five acres) of orchards; this year he could manage only 800.

Blame it on climate change



Experts blamed a combination of factors for the attack: Early, intense snowfall in November 2019 —which usually hampers yield — was followed by an extremely wet monsoon, which aids fungal growth. The quality of pesticides is also being questioned.

Farmers may have missed applying fungicides due to heavy rains in March-April, said Asha Nabi, an assistant professor of plant pathology at the Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology (SKUAST).

A section of the farmers have alleged that the meteorological department went astray with its predictions.

Apples with a scab infection fetch less than half the market rate compared to a healthy fruit. Photo: Kamran Yousuf

Scab spray must be scheduled religiously beginning February till the harvest season. Farmers usually also spray small doses of pesticides from February until the November harvest.

Many failed to sanitise their orchards due to untimely snow, she added: “The inoculum load was high in 2020 and, therefore, the high scab incidence in apple growing areas.”

Nabi pointed to the changing climate in the Valley and stressed on orchard sanitation, which includes burning fallen leaves in autumn.

Shafeeq Ahmad, assistant professor, Entomology Dryland Agricultural Station, SKUAST, Kashmir, also cited heavy, continuous rainfall as a major reason for the infection.

Use of spurious pesticides may have hampered disease prevention as well, he added. The Jammu and Kashmir horticulture department failed to monitor pesticide quality, leading to spurious stocks, Malik alleged. Farmers like Mohammed also alleged that the chemicals sold in the market were spurious.

Experts from SKUAST said infections from the primary infection must be prevented with well-timed fungicide spraying during blossoming, early leafing and fruit development.

How it works

Leaves and fruits are highly susceptible to apple scab when they are young and growing. Mature leaves and fruits gain resistance as they age, according to 2019 study conducted by SKUAST.

“During the main growth period in early spring, there is more susceptible tissue available for infection and therefore, greater risk of disease,” the study observed.

It noted that apple scab generally did not kill trees, but can cause defoliation, that weakens the tree and influences its survival during winter conditions. It observed that early infections could lead to abnormal growth (fruit deformation) and fruit drop.

“The lesions on the fruits are similar to those on the leaves, but as they age, they produce cracks. If the fruit is infected late in the summer or just before harvest, black, circular, minimal (0.1-4 mm diameter) lesions called ‘pin-point scab’ would appear during storage,” it said.

The study noted that the leases could be managed by successful apple scab disease management that requires an integrated approach, depending on the grower’s goals. Such approach combines resistant cultivars, cultural practices, biological agents and use of fungicides.

The disease can be minimised / prevented through good horticultural practices such as selecting sites that provide more than six hours of sunlight a day; spacing trees adequately following proper pruning practices to open the tree canopy; sanitising in orchards to prevent pseudothecial formation in overwintering apple leaves.

Outbreak not alone

The absence of crop insurance will likely hit the farmers even more.

“Apple is a perishable item and the chances of losses are quite high. The government has been trying to get private players to insure the orchards, but no company has shown interest so far,” said Manzoor Ahmad Mir, deputy director, planning and marketing wing, horticulture department.

The apple industry provides livelihood to over 47 per cent of the population of Kashmir. The region has more area under apple cultivation than the United States, the world’s second-largest producer. Some 2 million tonnes are exported annually for about Rs 8,000 crore, according to the department.

Nearly half of India’s total land under apple cultivation and high yield has meant 70 per cent of the country’s apples come from the Union territory: 1,940,236 tonnes of apples in 2017-18; 2,093,386 tonnes in 2018-19 and 1,950,600 tonnes in 2019-20.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), of course, would make things different. Farmers have blamed the pandemic for the infection, apart from substandard fungicides for the breakout of the infection.

Farmers couldn’t buy fertilisers due to the lockdown to curb the pandemic, Kashmir’s horticulture director Aijaz Ahmad Bhat said.

“It was only when I took up the matter with higher officials that the government allowed shops to provide fertilisers. Unfortunately, most orchids did not follow the modified schedule and skipped spraying,” he claimed.

Bhat rued his department was “powerless” when it came to regulating licences to fertiliser dealers, checking of samples, among other things.

The infection anyway come after the unusual circumstances created by the abrogation of Article 370 last year, since when the region has been under a communications blockade. As landline, mobile and internet services remained shut, traders could not do business as usual. Malik estimated traders’ losses last year at around Rs 8,000 crore.",0
799179,The curse of plenty,"If Kerala can't solve its water problem, who can?

THE steady downward trend of rainfall in Kerala for the past five years went unnoticed. The rapid fall in groundwater, too, didn't raise eyebrows. With 44 rivers and an annual average rainfall of 3,000 mm, Kerala goes to sleep with sweet dreams of water all around. But in February 2004, the state woke up with a bad dream. A drought in Kerala is shocking news, as is suicide by 11 farmers in Wayanad district (since April 2004). The state government claims a loss of Rs 2,844 crore due to drought. Farmers have to make additional investment to deepen borewells, with the water table touching the depth of 250 metres in some places.



This epitomises our polity's lack of foresight. Modern society has a bad habit of reaching for the last bit of resource very easily, assuming that additional capital investment will bring more of it. Kerala has reached for the last drop all too quickly. A sense of plenty has wreaked havoc, high literacy and science education notwithstanding. Since 1956, the state has spent Rs 3,245 crore on irrigation projects to service large-scale paddy cultivation. But the area under paddy has declined by more than 50 per cent area in the last 46 years. This excessive investment on irrigation hasn't helped the drinking water crisis. In Kerala, paddy helps recharge groundwater. So the loss in paddy area is opportunity lost in groundwater recharge too. Nobody's studied if the decline in rainfall is linked to a long-term metereological change. There is no sign of public research to find out how Kerala can manage its rainfall endowment.



It took a conflict with a soft-drink manufacturer to reveal the severity of groundwater extraction in the state. Excessive sandmining is also causing public protests -- experts fear that all sand in seven rivers in Greater Kochi region will be over in decade. But a powerful nexus wins over the science of riverflow.



It seems that all the science movement and education drive has gone to waste in Kerala. And its hourglass has no sand anymore.",0
796640,"White fly attack, untimely rains and drought; Rajasthan farmers stare at losses","Farmers are now banking on the Rabi crops as they lost hopes of a good income in the Kharif season

Sarvar Khan showed a group of tiny deadly white fly pests flying in his 3.2-hectare (ha) BT cotton field with a wry laugh.

“In the last three years, my pesticide bill was almost zero and in this crop season I have sprayed pesticides about 12 times till now, but in vain. It is still everywhere,” he said

Cotton is the main Kharif crop in his village, Mirzewala, in Rajasthan’s Ganganagar district. The white fly has attacked almost all of the farmer’s fields.

“Usually, I get 5-6 quintal from 1 bigha (0.2 ha), but this time it is only 1-1.5 quintal,” said Khan.

In the neighbouring village Daulatpura, too, farmers complain of a white fly attack of a similar nature.

“First there were not enough rains and all the crops were impacted due to high temperatures and now the white fly attack has just increased our troubles,” said 48-year-old Iqbal Singh.

He and his family are already under stress as his income from selling milk was hit after their only milk-giving cow died due to lumpy skin disease.

Farmers across the state are a worried lot. Excess rainfall in July, drought-like conditions affecting crops in Bikaner district, white fly attack on cotton in Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts and now untimely excessive rainfall in several districts damaging ready-to-harvest crops have hit Rajasthan farmers hard.

Madan Lal Bagra from Radhakishanpura village in Jaipur district is anticipating a loss of 25 per cent in his almost ready-to harvest bajra (pearl millet) and groundnut crops due to incessant rains in the last three days.

“The rains have not been heavy but they have been continuous which is leading the crops to rot. The crops were in the maturity stage and I was about to harvest them soon,” he said.

Bajra has broken in many plants. And the groundnut will become black from rainfall. Now, they can be cut only when the plants completely dry out, he added.

He has sown bajra in 6 ha and groundnut in 2 ha land.

On the other hand, farmers in Charanwasi village in Hanumangarh district have not seen good rainfall since January, this year. Many fields are empty, with farmers not even getting the water from the Indira Gandhi feeder canal.

“Last proper rainfall was on January 1, this year. After that we haven’t had any good spell of rain even during the monsoon months in the village,” said Om Prakash, a farmer.

There have been sporadic rain events wetting fields only till 3 inches. We cannot sow anything in such situation, he added.

He sowed cotton on his 0.58 ha land. High temperatures and no rainfall in the monsoon months led to crop failure.

“Water from the canal came to the village for the first time in six months in August, but that was just enough for drinking purposes,” another farmer Bajrang from Charanwasi village, said.

The farmers are now banking on the Rabi crops of chana, mustard and wheat as they lost hopes of a good income in the Kharif season.

Kalu Ram, a farmer from 1 LKD village in Bikaner, is staring at losses from his guar crop (legume) that he is yet to harvest. The crop in his field looks tall, but the pod development has not happened in many of the plants, said Ram.

“In July there was good rainfall, more than what we usually get. But after that when rain is actually required at the pod development stage, it didn’t happen. To add to it, the temperatures were higher than usual,” he said.",0
796699,Fall Armyworm attack: 'It is the biggest pest attack ever',"The worm prefers maize, but its diet comprises up to 300 plant species, including vegetables and ornamental plants

The spread of Fall Armyworm (FAW) is nothing like we have ever seen with previous pests. We have faced pestilences like wheat blast or the Maize Lethal Necrosis. But in all the previous cases, the incidents were mostly limited to a few countries and also limited to a single crop. With FAW the threat is much bigger, in terms of extent of damage caused both of crop varieties affected as well as the area impacted. FAW reached India in July 2018 and attacked both kharif and rabi crops of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra, Odisha and West Bengal. Now, it has spread to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, south China and Vietnam. It has not spread to the northwestern India as yet.



The worm prefers maize, but its diet comprises up to 300 plant species, including vegetables and ornamental plants. To prevent the worm from infiltrating, a country needs to effectively quarantine imported goods. European countries have detected incidents of FAW eggs on ornamental plants in the last couple of years. Once the worm enters a country, there is no way to stop its spread. Its effect can be minimised through monitoring, surveillance and creating awareness among farmers to scout their crops for early detection. The US has been able to control the pest because 90 per cent of its maize cultivation is genetically modified. Brazil, Argentina and Chile are doing the same. Pest has grown resistant to Bt maize, prompting a new hybrid variety to be brought in. In Africa, which does not use Bt maize, the pest damaged crops worth US $2 billion in 2017-18 alone.

611,"Pakistan flood victims hit by disease outbreak amid stagnant water

","KARACHI: Skin infections, diarrhoea and malaria are rampant in parts of Pakistan's flood-ravaged regions, killing 324 people, authorities said on Wednesday, adding that the situation may get out of control if required aid doesn't arrive.

Hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the floods are living in the open, and as floodwaters - spread over hundreds of kilometres - may take two to six months to recede, stagnant waters have led to serious health issues.


With Pakistan's already weak health system and lack of support, displaced families have complained of being forced to drink and cook with disease-ridden water.

""We know it can sicken us, but what to do, we have to drink it to stay alive,"" flood victim  ..

""The aid is slow to arrive,"" said Dr. Farah Naureen, Mercy Corps' country director for Pakistan after visiting several submerged regions.

""We need to work in a coordinated manner to respond to their immediate needs,"" she said in a statement late Monday, prioritising clean drinking water. Health and nutrition stand out as the most important needs of the displaced population, she said.

The southern Sindh provincial government on Wednesday said makeshift health facilities and mobile camps in the flooded areas had treated more than 78,000 patients in the last 24 hours, and more than 2 million since July 1.

Out of them, six died, it said.

Deaths from diseases aren't among the 1,569 people who were killed in flash floods, including 555 children and 320 women, the country's disaster management agency said on Wednesday.


A historic and intense monsoon dumped about three times as much rain on Pakistan as the three-decade average, which, combined with glacial melt, caused unprecedented flooding.

The deluge has affected nearly 33 million people in the South Asian nation of 220 million, sweeping away homes, crops, bridges, roads and livestock in damages estimated at $30 billion.

798783,Telangana farmers pushed to suicide after pest attack destroys chilli crop,"There has been no announcement on compensation to farmers who have lost their crops

Twenty farmers have died by suicide since January 2022 in Telangana’s Mahabubad district after insect infestation destroyed their chilli crop, a ground survey by the Human Rights Forum (HRF) and Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) has claimed. Five suicides have also been reported in Khammam district.

Thrips parvispinus, an invasive pest from Indonesia, has spread rapidly, especially in the two states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Almost half of the total red chilli crop in Telangana has been affected, state government officials said.

The pest attack affected hundreds of farmers, especially tenant farmers, according to HRF and RSV.

Madhava Rao Gorepatti, president, Human Rights Forum, Telangana, told Down To Earth that all 20 suicides in Mahabubad took place within a two-month period because the farmers were in debt ranging from Rs 6-12 lakh.

“Most of the deaths were of tenant farmers. The lands taken on lease vary from 2-6 acres. The thrips disease roasts the entire crop,” Gorepatti added.

Around 40-80 per cent of the damage to the chilli crop in the two states was as a result of the pest invasion, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament February 4, 2022,

Since Thrips parvispinus is an invasive pest species, it might have dominated / replaced the native chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis through competition, Tomar had said in his statement to Parliament.

Tomar had added that the change in weather / climatic conditions during the crop season might have favoured the establishment of the invasive species and thus resulted in its sudden upsurge.

The species, which was first reported in India in 2015, was also said to be carrying a virus which led to further spread of the disease. But not much is known about it.

“It has also spread to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra now,” an official from the horticulture department of Telangana, said.

Farmers in a vice

On an average, chilli farmers get a yield of 50 quintals in a one hectare (ha) area. They got less than half of this quantity after the pest attack. The quantity was just five quintals in one ha in many cases.

Hailstorms added to the losses already inflicted by the pest attack, affecting almost 8,100 ha in the state, a government official said.

But there has been no announcement on compensation to farmers who have lost their crops.

Telangana doesn’t have any crop insurance scheme of its own. It has already opted out from the Union government’s Pradhan Mantri Bima Fasal Yojana (PMFBY).

“The damage is also in Andhra Pradesh but there, the likelihood of getting some sort of relief either from PMFBY or other crop loss compensation is more as it has its own crop insurance scheme,” Kiran Kumar Vissa from RSV said.

He added that in Telangana, the government’s earlier promise of compensation after crop loss due to heavy rains in January has also not been fulfilled till now.

The need for compensating farmers is even more as chilli is a high investment crop with farmers investing around Rs 80,000-100,000 per acre.

“It is a very heavy loss. A lot of these farmers are tenant farmers, who pay an additional lease amount of Rs 20,000-25,000 per acre. They don’t get any bank loans and are completely indebted,” Vissa said.",0
798887,"Amid cold, heat, suicides, January 26, COVID-19, farmer protests complete 6 months","The farmers protesting on Delhi’s borders observed May 26 as a ‘Black Day’ and vowed to continue the protests

The protest by farmers on the borders of Delhi against the three agricultural laws — Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers (Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 — completed six months May 26, 2021.

Farmers across the protest sites hoisted black flags atop their houses, shops, offices, tractors, cars, jeeps, scooters, motorcycles, buses and trucks to mark it as a ‘Black Day’ for India. This was in accordance with a call given by the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), a joint front of farmer unions spearheading the protest.

The effigies of the Modi government were burnt at major protest sites like Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur. The SKM said farmers across a number of states — Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Odisha, Kolkata, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Jammu and Kashmir, Tripura and Assam — marked the Black Day in various ways.

Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal) Chief Sukhbir Singh Badal also raised a black flag at his house and urged the Union government to repeal the laws.

The agitation began in November last year. It saw thousands of farmers marching towards Delhi and camping at its Singhu and Tikri border posts November 26, 2020. This happened after meetings with the Union agriculture ministry regarding the farmers’ concerns on the laws did not result in anything concrete.

The movement has faced several hardships and challenges in the last six months: Farmers braving winter cold and summer heat and meticulously planning the Rabi harvest and post-harvest operations despite the ongoing protest, criticism for the Republic Day tractor rally turning violent and for gathering in large numbers amid the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and even the deaths of 470 farmers, either by suicide or other reasons.

The SKM said May 26 the repeated attempts of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government(s) to portray the movement as violent had failed repeatedly. Farmers had only strengthened themselves with peace and non-violence throughout the struggle, it added.

Last week, leaders of 12 opposition parties, including the Congress, the Trinamool Congress, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Samajwadi Party had extended their support to the farmers’ call for a country-wide protest May 26.

The SKM also called the seven-year rule of the BJP at the Centre since 2014 the most “anti-farmer”:

It has also been the most anti-farmer rule in the country so far, from May 26, 2014, when the BJP formed a government at the Centre. From the time Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, multiple anti-farmer measures have been adopted over seven long years.

Whether it was the dilution of the Land Acquisition Act 2013 or the failure to provide minimum support price (MSP) or even decent hikes in MSP announcements, the Modi government had amply proven itself to be anti-farmer.

This was also reflected in its policies like demonetisation or failure to protect farmers from natural disasters in the age of climate change or the current egotistic attitude towards the ongoing farmers’ struggle, the SKM said.

The farmers vowed to continue the protest “for however” long it took.

“The Government of India can choose to remain unwise in stretching this longer without resolving the demands of the farmers. But this would be at its own loss and at the expense of BJP’s supporter base,” the SKM said.",0

Farmers claim that poor income from agriculture has deteriorated their quality of life. Photo: Aishwarya Iyer.

Years of weather vagaries such as drought and extreme rainfall, combined with poor quality agricultural products and policies of the state government have pushed Marathwada farmers towards poverty.

Down To Earth visited farmers from Marathwada and Ahmednagar in Maharashtra to note how the cumulative effect of frequent crop losses altered their lives.

The farmers in the central part of the state told DTE how they have started to feel the brunt of climate change in their daily lives.

Also read: Climate change escalates suicide rates among Marathwada farmers

Simultaneous droughts and floods have become an increasing concern and the instances have escalated in the past five decades, according to a report published by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in 2020.

Drought events in the state, especially in drought-prone regions of Aurangabad, Latur, Jalna, Nanded, Osmanabad of Marathwada and Pune and Nashik, rose to 14 in 1980-89 from 11 in 1970-79, the report stated.

The events scaled to 17 in 1990-99 and 23 between 2000 and 2010. Some 79 cases were reported between 2010 and 2019.

Also read: Extreme rainfall damages nearly 4 million hectares of crops in Marathwada

Farmers claim that poor income from agriculture has deteriorated their quality of life and increased suffering.

“I sowed cotton and soyabeans this Kharif season on my five acres of land. But the weather pattern affected its growth and health,” said Sharad Shinde, a 25-year-old farmer from Mankhurwadi village near Beed in Marathwada.

After the first few spells of rain in June, the monsoon took a break for almost a month, said Shinde.

“The crop growth stunted. It received better rains in July and August. But the rains in September did more damage than good,” he said.

Crops do not require much water in the final stages and it rained heavily for a week in September, he added.

“The crops rotted and I lost over 50 per cent of my standing plantation, which I was waiting to harvest by the first week of October,” he said.

There are millions of farmers who share Shinde’s plight. Over 4.5 million farmers in Marathwada alone have faced the brunt of weather extremities through September 2022, according to official figures.

Forty-year-old Mahadev Trimbak from Beed district said his expenditure on input cost had increased three-fold over the last few years. The cost of fertilisers, pesticides and seeds have manifolded in the past decade.

“I spend at least Rs 25,000-Rs 30,000 per acre as production cost against Rs 10,000 per acre a few years ago,” he said. At the same time, income has reduced as the crops do not fetch the deserved prices in the market. The selling prices have not increased at par with inflation, he explained.

Trimbak said his income had been reduced by at least 50 per cent. “If the weather does not bless us, it is a total loss ensuring that we never recuperate from the losses or have the ability repay the loans,” he told DTE.

Seeds, insecticides and pesticides in the market are often duplicated or of poor quality, affecting the yield and output further, he said.

It may be noted that drought and extreme rainfall have been taking a heavy toll on farmers’ income.

Reduced income, crop losses and irreparable economic damages due to the inability to repay loans have worsened over the past few years.

“I wanted to save money and buy a two-wheeler for my commute. But the repeated losses have not allowed me to do so,” said Vishal Alat, a farmer from Shrigonda in Ahmednagar.

Farmers across villages — Ambesavali, Dhekanmoha, Kalegaon, Mankhurwadi, Ghatsawali in Beed, Ambajogai and Jamgaon, Arangaon, Shrigonda and Jamkhed in Ahmednagar — shared similar sentiments about deteriorating social and economic status.

Kakasaheb Rode, a chairperson of the village committee and a farmer in Shrigonda, said the farmers have started selling their lands and possessions to survive.

Farming does not provide any income and farmers have been running in losses for at least the past five years. “I sold a part of my land for my daughter’s wedding and now have only three acres left. I cannot afford selling the meagre assets I own to survive,” he said.

Rode added that daily expenses are to be met and he has been living on credit. “I owe money to friends and relatives and now they have also reached their limits in providing financial assistance,” he said.

Mahesh Gade from Limpangaon village near Beed said he sold his four-wheeler to survive the COVID-19 lockdown and sustain the losses incurred due to poor crop production.

Like Gade, farmers in the village have started selling possessions. “Many friends and relatives in the village wanted their wives to undergo knee operations as years of toiling in the field have deteriorated their health. But we couldn’t afford the operation costs to tune of Rs 4.5 lakh,” Gade told DTE.

“The inflation has increased the production costs. The farmers’ economic situation has been shattered by the unfavourable weather and ongoing yield losses,” said Anil Ghanavat, national president of Swatantra Bharat Party and former president of Shetkari Sanghatna. Both organisations work for the cause of farmers.

The government should intervene and revise policies to uplift the farmers and help them escape the vicious cycle of poverty, said Ghanavat.",0
798848,Farmers mark a year of farm laws with ‘Bharat Bandh’,"Bharat Bandh, marking a year since passage of farm bills in Parliament, passes off peacefully

The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the joint front of farmer unions protesting against the three controversial farm laws, called September 27’s ten-hour-long ‘Bharat Bandh’ a success, nailing the “lie of the government’s propaganda”.

A complete shutdown was reported from states like Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and Bihar, according to SKM. All kinds of institutions, markets and transport were closed in these states from 6 AM to 4 PM.

There were reports from both, Punjab and Haryana, of national highways, state highways, link roads and railway tracks being completely blocked, bringing road and rail traffic to a halt.

In other states like Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, the shutdown evoked a mixed response.

It was on September 27, 2020, that President Ram Nath Kovind assented to and brought into force the three farm bills.

The bandh also marks ten months of the farmers’ protest, said to be the longest farmer protest till date. It was on November 26 and 27, 2020, that scores of farmers had reached Delhi’s borders to protest the three farm laws passed by the Centre.

On September 27, farmers organisations were joined by trade unions, organisations of youth and students and political parties in different parts of the country. Closure of national and state highways and blocking of railway tracks were also reported.

Traffic jams were reported at the Delhi-Gurugram border. Trains were blocked after farmers sat on the Delhi-Chandigarh railway track at the Sonepat railway station.

Traffic movement on a national highway connecting Surat to Mumbai was also blocked for some time by the protesters.

The Delhi-Meerut expressway was closed till 4 pm, due to which traffic towards Meerut was affected. The expressway was opened after the ‘bandh’ ended. The Eastern Peripheral Expressway was also temporarily closed as a precaution.

Bharat Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait called the ‘Bharat Bandh’ a success. “We had the full support of farmers. We can’t seal down everything as we have to facilitate the movement of people. We are ready for talks with government but no talks are happening,” he said.

Several political parties like the Indian National Congress, the ruling YSR Congress in Andhra Pradesh, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) in Kerala, Aam Aadmi Party, Samajwadi Party, Telugu Desam Party and Bahujan Samaj Party expressed their support for the protest.

More than 605 farmers have died during the agitation so far according to SKM, including two deaths related to police brutalities and some suicides too.

“Hundreds of cases have been slapped over the past many months on thousands of protestors, including with serious charges like sedition and attempt to murder,” a statement by SKM said.

Farmers had witnessed officials commanding police to ‘break the farmers’ heads’, but had continued their struggle for justice and survival undeterred, the statement added.",0
798888,Agriculture did not fall to COVID-19 last year; will there be an encore?,"India’s second wave has affected the Rabi post-harvest marketing season; it could also affect the Kharif season depending on the disease’s severity

Agriculture, the only sector to clock a positive growth of 3.4 per cent at constant prices in 2020-21, during the first wave of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), could be severely impacted due to the ongoing second wave.

The primary reason is that COVID-19 is running riot in the country’s rural hinterland, where most agricultural activity takes place, during the second wave.

The second wave has had an impact on the just-concluded Rabi season. It could also impact the upcoming Kharif season, depending on the trajectory of the pandemic, experts said.

Rabi losses

Farmers have harvested their Rabi crop. But sales have been impacted as COVID-19 infections have risen and mandis (wholesale markets) have remained closed since April 2021 due to lockdown-like restrictions in many states.

During the first wave, there were some supply chain issues related to the produce’s transport from the primary mandis to the secondary and bigger markets. But this time around, there are several concerns about taking the produce even to the primary mandis due to rising COVID-19 cases in rural areas and imposition of lockdowns.

Last year, even though the lockdowns were more stringent, primary mandis at village level were largely kept out of the restrictions. This was because the infections were low or nil in rural areas.

In states like Punjab and Haryana, where there is high government procurement, most of the wheat crop has been lifted. But this is not the case in other wheat-producing states like Uttar Pradesh (UP), Madhya Pradesh (MP), and Rajasthan.

Comparative data of wheat arrivals between May 1-May 21, 2021 and the same period last year shows the arrivals are dismal.

In MP, the arrivals are down by 2.3 million tonnes compared to last year — a 77 per cent decrease, data collated from Agmarknet, a government portal, shows. In UP, they are down by 36 per cent.

“It looks like more than 50 per cent of the overall wheat crop is still stuck in states like Rajasthan, UP, Maharashtra, and MP,” Prasanna Rao, co-founder and chief executive, Arya, a warehousing and finance platform for farmers and farmer producer organisations, said.

Soybean arrivals in MP are also down by 76 per cent.

Rao said:

For us, May is a busy month since a lot of harvest and commodity arrivals happen. But this time, it is a complete washout. There is an impact on farmers’ livelihood also as those who want to sell their produce are unable to do so. The transaction volume will likely increase towards the end of May or June when mandis will open.

In Maharashtra, the onion Rabi crop, which is harvested between March and May, is ready. But farmers have been unable to sell as all mandis in the state, including Lasalgaon, Asia’s largest onion mandi, have been closed since May 12.

The Rabi crop has a longer shelf life. But unseasonal rainfall in the last few days has led to the growth of fungus in some stored stocks, Bharat Dighole, a farmer and member of the Maharashtra State Onion Growers’ Association, said.

He added:

Almost 40 per cent farmers are not being able to sell their onion crop in Maharashtra. Farmers use the money they get from sale of this crop to buy seeds and fertilisers and prepare for the next crop like maize, cabbage and soybean in June. But they have no cash in hand this time.

Another major worry among farmers is that once the mandis open, there will be a sudden increase in arrivals which will result in a depression of prices for them. In Maharashtra, the mandis are supposed to open from May 24.

Upcoming Kharif

Even with the rise in cases and deaths, there is optimism about the performance of the agriculture sector, especially after the India Meteorological Department’s forecast of a normal monsoon in 2021.

The latest data from the Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Food Price Index further boosts this. It shows that global food prices in May were at their highest levels since May 2014. This too could benefit Indian farmers.

There is also hope that the disease situation would be much better by the time sowing for Kharif starts from mid-June. But on the other hand, the possibility of farmer families getting infected is also real and may impact sowing operations.

Siraj Hussain, former union agriculture secretary and now senior visiting fellow, Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, said:

The situation in rural areas is not completely known. We still don’t know the extent of the disease. If the pandemic is not brought under control, the Kharif sowing operations will be impacted. Everything depends on progress of the disease.

Rao, whose organisation works with farmers in around 19 states, said the awareness level among farmer households was still quite low.

“For example, in rural areas of UP, there is very less awareness on what do if somebody has symptoms or even when infection is confirmed. Moreover, people are still going about having weddings and functions and the testing rates are also low,” he said.

The return of migrant labourers to their villages has posed another problem for farmers. This is especially true for states like Punjab and Haryana that are highly dependent on agricultural labourers from UP and Bihar for the sowing of paddy.

In 2020 too, the labourers had returned to their villages but were brought back by contractors during the paddy sowing season. But this could be done because the villages were still left untouched by the infections and most labourers were in a healthy condition.

The shrinking of the female labour force participation post-pandemic and especially after the second wave may further affect sowing operations as around 80 per cent of farm work is undertaken by women in India.

Pradeep Kashyap, founder of Rural Marketing Association of India, said:

With the infection rate rising in rural India, we are seeing a trend of women members of the household dropping out of the labour work force to either take care of the ill people in the house or to not go for work since they will be required to stay healthy to take care of the household.

Meanwhile, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has also anticipated that the operations / logistics can be seriously impacted during the pre-Kharif and Kharif period.

In an advisory issued May 20, it said the second wave may impact agricultural production and national food and nutrition security.

It asked farmers to enhance the use of on-farm inputs, especially organic manures, to cope with shortages in labour and timely availability of inputs at affordable prices. “Adopt best practices for increasing resource use efficiency and reduce cost of cultivation,” it said.

Experts said COVID-19 will have to be controlled in rural areas and vaccination and testing will have to be increased rapidly for agriculture to make another positive contribution to the economy.

“It will all depend on what the government plans to do to tackle the infection rates,” Hussain said.

Rao added that to boost the agriculture performance, access to different services and inputs has to be made easy amid lockdowns in different states. “Access to finance is also very critical at this point,” he said.",0
798893,"We will continue, let govt set up COVID-testing centres here: Farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders","Farm leaders ask protestors to beware of COVID-19 while plannign to beef up protests

Farmers protesting against the three central agriculture-related laws said there movement would continue and the Narendra Modi government should set up vaccination centres at demonstration sites.

The Samyukt Kisan Morcha, an umbrella body of farmer unions spearheading the protest, appealed to farmers to follow necessary norms and take precautions like wearing masks.

The peasants have planned to strengthen their agitation and have been chalking out programmes to do so.

Tens of thousands of farmers who returned to villages for harvesting and selling wheat are scheduled to resume demonstrations at the protest site by end-April.

Farmer leaders will also campaign against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Panchayat elections in Uttar Pradesh, said Buta Singh Burjgill, president, Bhartiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).

Jagmohan Singh, another farm leader, said:

Campaigning in elections is slowly becoming a part of our movement. We didn’t want to be involved politically, but we will tell people to vote any party they like except the BJP.

Plans for a march to Parliament next month were afoot too.

Many protestors were apprehensive that the Union government might take legal recourse to remove them once the Assembly elections, currently underway, conclude.

“They may approach the Supreme Court and make the coronavirus the excuse. But we are prepared for anything,” Burjgill said.

Agriculturists started camping at Delhi’s Singhu, Tikri, and Ghazipur borders four-and-a-half months ago: They have been through a chilling winter and now face a sweltering summer even as the tally of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases sore.

On most occasions earlier, the farmers termed the pandemic a “conspiracy” by the government to stall their agitation. But with more and more reports on increasing cases and deaths, protestors are being asked to take all necessary precautions.

“There has not been one COVID-19 case among us till now. Why is there talk of the disease only when it comes to us and not when the election rallies are being held?” asked Gurnam Singh.

798939,Fall armyworm bane back in Bihar’s maize-growing eastern districts,"More than 2,000 hectares of maize affected by FAW attacks in Madhepura district alone

Farmers in Bihar have been hit hard by the fall armyworm (FAW) attacks on their maize crops.

The FAW attack, according to official reports, has been reported from the state’s eastern districts such as Madhepura, Purnia, Bhagalpur, Saharsa and Khagaria.

Madhepura experiences floods every year, as a result of which most farmers have started growing maize instead of paddy.

“More than 2,000 hectares where maize was cultivated has been affected by the FAW in Madhepura. It is spreading fast,” assistant director, state plant protection division, Sanjeev Kumar Tanti told Down to Earth.

The deadly FAW was first spotted in India in May 2018. As of 2020, it has spread to as many as 14 states, according to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar. It is an invasive and polyphagous (feeding on many foods) pest. It can attack cereals and forage grasses.

“We are keeping a tab on the situation and holding awareness camps at the Panchayat level to inform farmers on how to save their crops,” Tanti said.

He also visited some affected areas in Madhepura and gathered information on the FAW spread. Chausa, Alamnagar, Purani, Udakishunganj, Bihariganj and Muraliganj blocks are among the worst-affected.

State agriculture department officials said the FAW are dangerous as they can travel more than 200 kilometres in one night in search of food. “The feed on maize because of the presence of cellulose in it,” joint director, state plant protection division, Pramod Kumar said.

He added the department had issued alert about the FAW attacks and issued advisories through the newspapers and TV news channels about pest control.

“All our officials in the districts have been visiting farmers and holding Kisan Chaupals to inform them about this inspects,” Kumar said.

Several farmers lamented they planted maize after losing their produce to floods. “I planted maize crops in two hectares of land and more than half my crop has been damaged by FAW attacks. How will I recover the loss?” said Arun Kumar, a farmer from Phulaut village in Chausa block.

Ganesh Kumar Singh said he started growing maze after his paddy crops were damaged in floods.

The eastern region of Bihar is popularly known as the ‘maize hub’ where the crop is cultivated in around two lakh hectares of land. The average annual crop production has been around 22 lakh tonnes, but in 2019, around 40 per cent of total maize crops were reportedly destroyed by FAW.

798820,"As told to Parliament (November 30, 2021): 5,579 Indian farmers died by suicide in 2020","All that was discussed in the House through the day

Some 5,579 Indian farmers died by suicide in 2020, Union Minister of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar, told the Lok Sabha November 30, 2021.

The figures are according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), that has published reports on farmer suicides up to 2020. These reports are available on its website.

Tomar added that the Union government had received no report on farmers, especially in Madhya Pradesh, committing suicide due to unavailability of fertiliser.

Crop damage

Cyclonic storms / flash floods / floods / landslides / cloudburst, etc, had affected approximately five million hecatres of agricultural area during 2021, Narendra Singh Tomar told the Lok Sabha.

Climate change impact

Yields of rainfed and irrigated rice, wheat and kharif maize were likely to be reduced under projected climate change scenarios in the absence of any adaptation measures, Tomar told the Lok Sabha.

Agricultural contingent plans had prepared for 650 districts to cope up with any climatic aberrations, Tomar said.

Farmer income

The average monthly income per agricultural household during agricultural year July 2018-June 2019 was highest in Meghalaya, followed by Punjab and Hayana, Tomar told the Lok Sabha.

These were the findings of a survey carried out by the National Statistical Office (NSO) as part its 77th round.

Pregnant women

Some 52.2 per cent pregnant women in the age group 15-49 years in India are estimated to be anaemic, according to the recently released National Family Health Survey-Vdata, Bharati Pravin Pawar, minister of state in the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare told the Rajya Sabha.

COVID-19 vaccination

Some 781 million beneficiaries have received at least one dose of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, Pawar told the Rajya Sabha.

She added that 1.01 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administered since May 1, 2021, at government COVID-19 vaccination centres while only 40 million doses had been administered at private ones.

Zika cases

Some 231 cases of the Zika virus have been reported from three Indian states in 2021. These are Uttar Pradesh (147), Kerala (83) and Maharashtra (1). No deaths have occurred due to this virus, Pawar told the Rajya Sabha.

Pawar added that Uttar Pradesh’s 147 cases had been reported from the districts of Kanpur (139), Lucknow (6), Unnao (1) and Kannauj (1).

Economic recovery

India’s real gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated to have contracted by 7.3 per cent during FY 2020-21, according to the latest estimates released by the NSO.

This contraction reflected the unparalleled effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and the containment measures that were taken to control the pandemic, Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Union Ministry of Finance told the Rajya Sabha.",0
798986,State of India’s environment: Why farmers kill themselves,"The back of the Indian farmour is against the wall amid rising costs of inputs, climate change-induced risks and faulty market mechanisms

More than 28 farmers and farm labourers die by suicide in India every day, according to the 2021 State of India’s Environment (SoE) report — an annual brought out by Down To Earth in association with Delhi-based non-profit Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

The SoE report highlighted the suicide numbers in recent years:

5,957 farmers in 17 states (and Union territories) and 4,324 farm labourers in 24 states in 2019

5,763 farmers in 20 states and 4,586 agricultural workers in 21 states in 2018

The toll in increased between the two years in:

Andhra Pradesh Assam Chhattisgarh Himachal Pradesh Maharashtra Mizoram Punjab Uttar Pradesh Andaman & Nicobar Islands.

The report will be released in New Delhi February 25, 2021 at a webinar by more than 60 environmental thinkers and activists, journalists and academics from across India.

The National Crime Records Bureau is silent on what leads to farmer suicides, pointed out DTE Managing Editor Richard Mahapatra. A 2016-17 government report had listed three probable causes: Frequent crop failures due to vagaries of monsoons, lack of assured water, and pest attacks and diseases. “The true reason behind these deaths is that agriculture has become a severely loss-making profession and calling. The market does not the pay our farmers their due price,” Mahapatra said.

CSE Director-General Sunita Narain dug deeper on how the Indian farmer is at a disadvantage even as their counterparts in developed countries are well taken care of by their governments:

(They) do not get the financial support needed to make farming lucrative. At the same time, the cost of inputs — from seeds to water and labour — is increasing; risks are going up as well because of climate change-triggered extreme weather. When their crops become costly, the government steps in to import cheaper food. Our farmers, thus, suffer at both ends. It is for this reason that they are demanding a minimum support price (MSP) as an insurance against price volatility.

The existing MSP system is faulty: While MSP is fixed for 22 crops, in reality it is used only for a few (wheat, paddy, etc) for which the government has a procurement system, Narain pointed otu. The government’s own data reveals that almost 70 per cent market transactions for 10 select crops in 600 wholesale markets were at below MSP.

“India has been reeling from a severe agrarian distress for some years now; suicides by farmers and farm labourers are a tragic and painful manifestation of this distress. It is time we talked about the real cost of the food we eat, and about how to benefit the farmers who grow our food,” she added.

798995,"Future of Indian agriculture and small farmers: Role of policy, regulation and farmer agency","The distress among small farmers in India is market-driven to a large extent in both ways — too much protection (minimum support price) or too little

The question of future of Indian agriculture has been around for some time now since the agrarian distress and crisis in the sector. It has become important in the context of the spate of recent reforms that include permitting private wholesale markets, contract farming, direct purchase from farmers and land leasing across states both under the earlier state-level Acts, and now under the central Acts.

But before this question is answered, it is important to profile the Indian agricultural sector and its major stakeholders, that is, land operating farmers-owners, tenants or leases.

It is common knowledge that the farm production sector contributes only 13 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and engages 44 per cent workforce. This presents a dismal picture of the sector as compared with other sectors, as the earnings are poor.

It is also known that 85 per cent of India’s farmers operate less than five acres of land, half of which in many parts of India may be dry / rain-fed and only a part of their income comes from farming activity now with others coming from wages, off-farm and non-farm activities.

Farmers (especially small) suffer from product and market risks and depend on non-institutional sources of credit for productive and non-productive purposes, which are interlocked with other markets like produce in states like Punjab.

Small farmers contribute 51 per cent of agricultural output with 46 per cent of operated land, and a much higher share (70 per cent) in high-value crops. However, small farmers are less literate and from marginalised communities. They are generally excluded from modern market arrangements such as contract farming or direct purchase.

Agricultural reforms

In this context, the recent reforms aim at bringing new investments in the farm sector, especially from the private corporate sector — domestic and global. It is assumed that in order to get such investments, deregulation of the sector is needed in terms of output market and farm input as well as services market and land market.

However, what is forgotten is that the scale is neither needed nor possible through the kind of reform and channels being undertaken; they have little to do with farm size, with the exception of land leasing law and the opening up of ceilings of land holdings. This may have many other contextual limitations like large landlessness and farmer attachment to land more as a sustenance or moral economy of the peasant.

Some land-related reforms may not happen that easily. But, better access to land for marginal and landless farmers and, even more crucially, equitable access to water, is a must to improve the performance of the sector.

However, most of the above assumptions are either faulty or deliberately misperceived. For example, many studies show that small farms produce as much as or higher value of output per unit area than that produced by the medium or large farms, which refutes the argument that small farms cannot be the future of Indian agriculture.

For example, income from farming per month per hectare is Rs 4,236 in Bihar and only Rs 3,448 in Punjab because Punjab is less diversified (only 11 per cent area under F&V in Punjab compared with 35 per cent in Bihar) in its cropping pattern compared with Bihar, though it does not have efficient or regulated agricultural markets.

The average size of farm in Bihar is only 0.39 hacs and in Punjab it is 3.62 hacs. Therefore, it is not the size of the farm but what a farmer does on that farm, when, how, where, why and for whom and how much, which makes it viable or not.

Given the cereals-dominated cropping pattern, farmers can only earn so much from the small farms. This is evident in the fact that a majority of the famers cultivate paddy and wheat in significant part of gross cropped area (69 per cent in Punjab and 40 per cent in Bihar). There are limits to how much they can earn as price (MSP, which drives market prices) is given and available only to a fraction of farmers (less than 10 per cent), yields are given and cost of production can’t be manipulated much.

Market risks

Even in other crops, only a very small fraction of farmers get MSP benefit in a few states where procurement happens. Further, once the farmer takes farm produce to the mandi, s/he can’t bring it back.

The market risks include absence of market, poor price realisation, high transaction cost and poor bargaining power due to small size of marketed surplus, leading to low and unstable farm incomes of producers.

It is here that the role of market becomes crucial: Even if a farmer has produced efficiently but is not able to sell it well, the story is lost. Imagine the gains for Bihar farmers if it had Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) markets and other marketing channels which are being promoted now and larger procurement at MSP.

Incidentally, Bihar has not seen too many farmer suicides, unlike Punjab. Therefore, MSP culture and too much reliance on low-value land intensive crops has been the culprit in many suicide-prone areas.

The distress among small farmers in India is, therefore, market-driven to a large extent in both ways — too much protection (MSP) or too little.

The problem of small farmer livelihood is also aggravated due to small farmers suffering from several production risks such as drought, flood, lack of adequate use of inputs, poor extension leading to large yield gap, crop failure, etc.

The production risk coverage, being attempted though crop insurance, has not worked well. It has been made voluntary for farmers and would further reduce the insured area from already inadequate coverage of 30 per cent.

Most problematic is the farmers’ reliance on traders, commission agents and moneylenders for credit, for institutional credit reaches only 65 per cent of them and more of small and marginal farmers are excluded from this net.

This private source borrowing leads to interlocking of credit and output, input and output, and credit and input markets where there is implicit over-pricing of farm inputs and under-pricing of farm output of the farmers. They can’t access other channels even if they offer better prices, as they don’t offer credit to farmers who are tied to traders and agents.

This restricts their freedom to choose channels provided by new APMC Acts and now central Acts. Further, if smallholders and tenants belong to lower castes, their access to credit may be limited either by way of complete denial of credit to such groups / persons or costly access because of higher rate of interest charged or unfavourable terms of repayment.

This makes their farming enterprise unviable. It is important to realise that smallholders suffer from high market and price fluctuation risk as well as institutional mechanisms to deal with. The prices are still determined and driven by APMC markets, which are still not adequately regulated and, in many cases, mistreat farmers.

New market channels (like contract farming and direct purchase) may emerge, but small farmers will continue to depend on APMC markets for many commodities.

Therefore, it is important to ensure fair functioning of such markets in terms of open auction, proper unloading and storage / handling of farmer produce especially perishable, which is generally auctioned from road side and filthy grounds and stopping of commission being charged to farmer sellers even in regulated markets in some states.

APMC markets also serve as the main competitors to contract farming and direct purchase channels that discover their prices based on APMC prices. Therefore, their better functioning can improve the terms offered to contract growers and direct sellers.

The future of agriculture in India depends on many existing and missing policies and directions of policy reforms. But, it is sad to note that India does not have a policy for the same. The sector loses its policy focus as it is a state subject, but practically being run by the Centre for long time. When the sector is faced with economic, social and environmental crisis, absence of policy is the major factor in the crisis not being attended by any stakeholder.

A pessimistic approach to farm sector saying it contributes only 13 per cent of GDP and engages 44 per cent workforce and, therefore, is as a liability, is the root cause of the policy distortions. On the other hand, if agricultural sector is seen as agribusiness sector that includes all activities performed on farm-based and allied raw produce right up to the retailing stage, it still contributes almost 25 per cent of GDP.

This perspective, argued by the author since 2007 and was recently acknowledged by World Bank, can pave the way for more meaningful policy and regulation for the sector. This perspective is needed to sustain livelihoods in this sector and avoid distress diversification or movement of people away from the sector.

Looking beyond market

Therefore, solutions go beyond produce markets; recent reforms are more about regulatory changes that do not really concern a majority of Indian farmers as they do not have access to APMC markets and other modern channels such as contract farming.

But, small farmers need to collectivise into groups and FPOs to lower transaction cost for private buyers and gain bargaining power in new markets.

Warehouse receipts system needs to be extended to all crops with expansion of facility to free farmers from credit and output linkage and avoid distress sale immediately after harvest and even get out of the inter-locked market situation.

There is no need for co-operative farming given the efficiency of even small farms. What is needed is pre-production and post production aggregation to buy better and sell better or to capture higher surplus in the food and fibre value chains.

Corporate farming has not worked anywhere globally and should not be encouraged in India; contract farming and producer agency through local institutions and networks can help sector perform better. Equally important is to train farm and allied sector workers, including women workers, to enable them to participate in modern and sustainable farm production.

The sector needs to engage with fair and responsible production and trade issues on a priority basis even for domestic markets. It is important to recognise that what matters is not just physical activities of the sector but its occupants and their livelihoods that would lead to more people-centric and meaningful policies.

A combination of livelihoods and agribusiness or value chain approach can help leverage the sector for betterment of its stakeholders i.e. farmers, workers and others around it.

Therefore, there is a need for a policy at union and state levels and even more effective regulation to protect small producer interest in a globalised market context to leverage the strengths of modern and large players in the agribusiness value chains for a win-win for all stakeholders involved so that inclusive and effective sustainable agricultural development could be attempted.

Therefore, there is a need for institutional innovations besides product, process and organisational innovations in the sector to deal with existing and emerging challenges and problems of sustainability in the sector which can be converted into opportunities.

The future of Indian agribusiness, including agriculture, would be bright if it is attended with people’s institutions like co-operatives and FPCs rather than relying mostly on corporate agencies.

799000,Being an Indian farmer…,"Five things you need to know about an Indian farmer’s life and why they are on the streets this Republic Day

A republic is where a people doesn’t have to give up its common interest for that of the ruling class; the ruling class is supposed to execute the will of the citizen. Understandably, it is impossible to make everyone happy. But expectations remain. Even after 71 years as a republic.

January 26, 2021 promises to be an exceptional R-Day. If 2020 was about the public owning up its day to make its point against the Narendra Modi government’s citizenship issues, this year is about the millions of farmers who form the foundation of India’s economy.

As their representatives ready to roll out their own caravan of tractors as a counterpoint to the official procession on Rajpath, the question remains: How does it feel being an Indian farmer? Here’s how the quintessential agriculturist would probably have put it:

Five points of my life you need to know as you celebrate republic day and why we are on the streets.

1

I am one of the smallest farmers in the world. The average landholding in India is 1.08 hectares; it would typically sustain eight persons. Smallholders now cultivate 42 per cent of operated land and constitute 83 per cent of total landholdings.

But I have two big and critical responsibilities that you might not have: I sustain myself and also feed the country, one of the world’s largest consumers of food grains.

India’s food self-sufficiency is because of me. In the last six years, I have been ensuring a bumper harvest of food grains non-stop.

Of the eight industry types, agriculture is the only sector has grown in 2020-21 despite the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.

Farmers like me make up the economy of Rs 20.13 lakh crore. Over half of Indians are into farming; every fourth voter is a farmer. That is the reason, I feel, you all love raising the slogan: ‘Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan’.

But you must have seen us more on the streets, either protesting or dumping our produce for not being able to get a fair price. In 2020, farmers from 22 states organised 71 protests. Did you ever raise the question: Why are farmers protesting?

2

My contribution to India’s gross domestic product (GDP) is on the decline. That is why economists say I am losing importance in the economy, and also for politicians.

But more and more households depend on agriculture for survival. My contribution to GDP has gone down from 51 per cent in the 1950s to around 16 per cent currently. But 70 million households depended on agriculture in 1951, which has now gone up to 120 million. In 1951, there were 22 million agricultural labourers; currently there are 144 million.

3

We all celebrate when data shows that India is emerging as one of the fastest growing economies of the world. But this growth has not impacted us.

Every second farmer in the country is indebted. An average Indian farmer earns Rs 6,426 per month while the expenditure is Rs 6,223. Also, only 15 per cent of farmers earn 91 per cent of the total agricultural income amid overwhelming inequality.

An analysis shows that a farmer earns only Rs7,639 from a hectare of wheat against the production cost of Rs 32,644. This is a huge loss of Rs 25,005 per ha.

I don’t have much to spend. But over 90 per cent of the country’s GDP comes from my consumption. Close to 50 per cent of the consumers in the country are wither farmers or from households that earn primarily from agriculture.

It means a sector already in crisis is holding the fort of the “fastest growing economy” of the world. Will it be able to sustain it? A big no and that is the severe warning for the overall economy.

4

In 2019, every hour nearly two persons involved in farming committed suicide in the country. This category accounts for 7.4 per cent of all suicides in India.

Climate change is impacting us the most. Government data shows that our income would come down by up to 25 per cent due to climate change impacts. The 100 poorest districts in the country, which are also dominated by agriculture, are the most vulnerable to climate change. We will suffer a loss of Rs 700 crore a year due to this.

Drought that hurts agriculture the most, particularly for rain-fed farming, is the second-most impactful type of disaster in terms of number of people affected in the world. It accounts for just five per cent of total disaster events.

But it affected 1.4 billion people in 2009-19. Over 50 per cent of Indian farmers depend on rain. Drought impacts nearly 30 crore farmers every year.

5

My fellow farmers are growing restless. Our Census 2011 says every day 2,000 farmers give up farming. Income from farming has already lost the prime spot in our total household total earnings.

In 1970, three-fourths of a rural household’s income came from farm sources. After 45 years, in 2015, it is less than one-third. Most of the households now earn more out of non-farm sources. In fact a daily wager earns more than a farmer.",0
799011,Farm laws 2020: Who are they meant to serve?,"In rushing the farm bills through Parliament on strength of numbers, the Union government seems to have handed short end of the stick to states and farmers

Farmers make up 60 per cent of the Indian population; farming 18 per cent of the country’s gross domestic product. Marginal farmers comprise 85 per cent of the total population of farmers.

The monthly income of agricultural households from cultivation has recorded a marginal increase since the national census in 2011: In 2016, the average monthly income of agricultural families was estimated around Rs 3,140. Almost 52 per cent of total rural agricultural households were estimated to be under heavy debt.

The average annual debt amount per agricultural household is estimated to be around Rs 104,602. These trends can be associated with increasing farmer distress, urban migration and suicide rates in rural India, especially among farmers.

Earlier this year, the Union government passed three heavily contested farm bills in Parliament. The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) bill, which aims to dismantle existing trade and distribution monopoly, is enjoyed by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and the Agricultural Produce Market (APMC).

This Act will now allow farmers to sell outside of their designated districts APMC, thereby advancing their interaction with the market directly.

The second is the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, which focuses on creating avenues for farmers to engage in contract farming through verbal or written contracts. This bill paves the way for farmers to access national and corporate markets.

The last is an amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, according to which, cereals, pulses, oilseeds, edible oils, onions and potatoes have been deregulated.

Together, the three bills aspire to liberalise and deregulate the market for the agrarian sector. The bills bring long-awaited reform to a key segment of the Indian economy.

As the thrust for development took this turn, it also left the farm sector dealing with outdated laws and systems. The Farmers Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services bill creates opportunities for farmers to engage in contract farming, selling their produce outside the APMC and expanding their access to market.

The Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce bill breaks the monopolistic situation afforded to the APMC-FCI structure. The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 changes the limitations on stockpiling and allows for staple crops to become commercial.

The three bills seek to transform agriculture in India. It would be beneficial to analyse the strengths and weakness of these bills through the lens of the market economy and potential impacts on the socio-economic situation of the farming community.

Strengths and opportunities

With the passing of the bills, the Union government has intended to liberalise farming with the short-term goal of doubling their current average monthly income. The government aspires to deregulate the sector and offer farmers the freedom of choice to sell their produce without restraint.

The bills will empower farmers through greater market access and expanded opportunities for commercial outcomes. By eliminating the APMC monopoly, the bills do away with the long-standing challenge of middlemen. The bills could also lead to an open market, enabling improved price discovery, supply chain efficiencies and dynamic market linkages.

The liberalisation of the market will introduce corporate and private investments in the industry. These investments can strengthen infrastructure, improve tools and modernise the sector. The open-market structure also allows the farmers to sell their produce online, an important change in an increasingly digital universe.

The increase in competition can potentially work to increase prices for farmers who are currently at the mercy of middlemen. In addition to these benefits, the availability of contract farming provides farmers with a price assurance instead of subjecting them to market uncertainty. There is also the possibility of firms providing farmers with input material as a part of contracts, thereby reducing input costs.

By amending the Essential Commodities Act, 1995, the government does away with stockpiling restrictions on several commodities. In doing so, the government intends to stabilise prices by driving supply chain efficiencies through access to stock.

These bills have the potential to create a similar impact as the New Economic Policy of 1991. This, however, is dependent on several independent actors and their motives.

Weaknesses and threats

By loosening the grip of APMCs, the government risks the possibility of farmers receiving prices below the minimum support price (MSP). A similar law was passed in Bihar in 2006 when the state abolished APMCs. A recent study conducted by the National Council for Applied Economic Research reported an increased volatility in grain prices.

Bihar witnessed farctured growth in agriculture after the repeal of the mandi system in 2006. These experiences have influenced a few agricultural economists, who believe that rebuilding the existing system might be a better course of action than tearing it down to introduce a new system altogether.

Another weakness in the plan is the lack of policy-level support for transporting farmer produce. At least 85 per cent of the Indian farming community comprises marginal farmers who do not have access to markets or transportation facilities.

The bills also create a sudden power vacuum in the market, thereby creating uncertainty in the production market. In case of gradual collapse in APMC systems, the government has not currently envisioned an alternate price setting mechanism.

Agriculture falls in the state list under the Constitution of India. However, the existence of Entry 33 in the concurrent list gives both the Centre and states the power to control production, supply and distribution of products in trade and commerce related to agriculture. With several state governments expressing dissent over the bills, it is likely that they would undermine the bills by exercising their power.

Rajasthan did this by designating all potential market areas as state-controlled areas. This blocks the Centre’s intention to create an open market in the absence of state regulations. Rajasthan is an example of how states might circumvent the bills by utilising their existing power.

It is also difficult to ensure that the big corporates do not enslave the already marginalised farmers. By allowing both verbal and written contracts, the Centre places the farmers at the vulnerable end of the bargain with no redress.

It is highly likely that big corporates bury the farmers in an avalanche of legal resources. There is no denying that there is a widely disproportionate access to legal resources between farmers and corporates and there seems to be no real law in place to safeguard the interests of the farmers.

Both farmers and consumers run the risk of exploitation by placing the market in the hands of big businesses.

Policy recommendations

To build trust among farmers and the states would be to include a mandate for MSP, as recommended by the Swaminathan Committee, within the ambit of the bills. Another would be to plug the holes in the current system instead of trying to dismantle and introduce a new structure.

The government also needs to make it mandatory for firms to draw up written contracts in vernacular languages and do away with verbal contracts. It may also be necessary to declutter the complexities surrounding export and import of agricultural produce, in alignment with the new bills.

The agricultural sector could also benefit greatly if the bills achieve harmony with the provisions related to self-help groups and farmer producer organisations to incentivise collectives, aimed especially at marginal and small holding farmers.

Conclusion

Despite being visionary in intent, the bills come with their own share of loopholes. In rushing the bills through parliament on the strength of numbers, the Union government seems to have handed the short end of the stick to the states and farmers.

A greater degree of consultation could have provided much needed impetus for the realisation of the vision for transformation. By not considering the voices of important stakeholders, the government has sown the seeds of mistrust and is currently facing a backlash.

Some states are contesting the bills in the Supreme Court, while others are trying to circumvent their way around them. In order to truly transform agriculture in India, the central government needs to be far more inclusive in their planning and decision-making processes.

It also needs to assure the farmers that the bills are not an attempt to phase out government procurement. Overall, the bills need significant amendments before vision can turn into reality.

799017,Why the new farm laws will not level the playing field,"Creation of unregulated private points of sale will only ensure that the produce continues to be sold as before — at below MSP and without any government support

More than 86 per cent farmers in India own or cultivate on less than two acres of land and have little surplus to sell. They are the victims of middlemen (arthiya) at the mandis (local exchange markets) and are forced, by circumstances, to sell their produce at very low prices often below their input costs.

The perishable nature of their produce also puts pressure on them to sell it off quickly, and which has skewed their bargaining position. Their produce is ‘risk-intense’ and often a victim of untimely rains, droughts, hail storms, infestation, etc. This often leads to partial or total loss of the farmer’s crop and income.

They have no meaningful crop insurance: This has been the reason for farmer loan defaults and over three lack farmer deaths over the past two decades. In 2019 alone, over 42,000 farmers and labourers died by suicide. The Economic Survey of India 2018-19 recommended a development strategy based on increasing incomes of this distressed segment.

Even in cases when farmers have a good crop, experience shows that they are unable to secure the minimum support price (MSP) at mandis. The MSP is the scientifically calculated government-announced minimum purchase price for crops, based on factors such as input cost of fertilisers, electricity, water, diesel, machinery, family labour, etc.

Cane farmer’s associations, for example, have sold their produce at less than half the MSP in Uttar Pradesh and are still waiting for their mandatory dues from 2014-15.

The matter is now with the Supreme Court. Corn growers — after the three contentious farm bills were passed in Parliament — have not secured the MSP. The Swaminathan Commission had recommended input costs to include costs plus family labour. Its recommendations, however, have not been implemented by any government so far.

It is clear that the farmers / farmer’s associations are ill-informed to negotiate minimum price. Leaving the farmers to their own devices to negotiate prices as is sought under the new legislation would put an average farmer in a helpless situation with no immediate outlet or skills to augment his income by other means.

Liberal economics aims at a level-playing field to the supply as well as demand side factors for sustenance of robust markets. In this case, the ground is clearly skewed and outcome may be civil distress and or unrest.

What is perhaps required is a skillful government regulation of existing mandis and not their practical abolition. The new enactments do not regulate the existing mandis but create parallel, unregulated ones.

The legislations

The three legislations — the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation ) Act, 2020 do not appear to address these concerns.

The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 was enacted to regulate the distribution and sale of essential commodities such as food items. Prior to the current amendment, items such as pulses, cereals, rice, onions were under its ambit.

The objective was to ensure procurement and sale at an appropriate price and ensure equitable distribution of food which was often subject of hoarding and black marketeering.

The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 marks a huge departure from this, and takes the above mentioned food items out of the purview of the Act. Thus the government may now not be bound to purchase the same and sell it through the public distribution system at fair prices to the poor.

The purchasers can now hoard as much as they like without any restriction, thereby influencing market prices to the detriment of the ultimate consumer. This was indeed the very mischief the enactment sought to remedy when it was first enacted.

In regard with the other two enactments, Article 246 of the Indian Constitution read with entry 14 of the Seventh Schedule places ‘agriculture’ and entry 28 places ‘markets’ exclusively in the domain of the state government.

This means that the Parliament could not have legislated on it. This also makes the remaining two Acts vulnerable for being struck down by the Supreme Court. This will create a huge uncertainty around these two Acts and their implementation.

The Second Act, [T]he Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, strangely leaves the farmer to negotiate a contract price with the sponsor.

The farmer is left to his own devices to negotiate aspects such as farm produce, produce price, quality, quantity, effects of pestilence, force majeure, food safety standards, labour to be employed. An average marginal farmer is ill-equipped to perform all these tasks.

There is no assurance of minimum support price guaranteed based on his input costs. The purchaser may refuse to buy his crop based on his arbitrary inspection. There is no provision for independent and fair inspection. This is likely to lead to distress selling.

The legislations will not correct skewed market conditions. The farmer will be out maneuvered and have no choice but to accept a one-sided contract. The Act overlooks the surfeit of historical experience in agri-economics, which clearly points out that farmers are ill-equipped to negotiate a fair price, even collectively.

Corporate players — with their bargaining position, understanding of contracts, financial strength, legal support systems as well as access to the governments — may completely refuse to offer the poor ill-educated farmer a fair sustainable price. The Union government would have to consider balancing the needs of producers and purchasers.

Any genuine dispute resolution by a civil court is excluded under section 19 of the Act. Adjudications envisaged before sub-divisional magistrate will be illusory as such the officer does not have legal training to provide the correct judicial outcome.

Assuming such dispute resolution were to take place the odds are heavily stacked against the farmers, who will have only the right to enforce an already one-sided contract and never be able to challenge its unconscionable nature.

Then, there is no embargo against the buyer to hoard the goods as they are now outside the purview of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The new legal regime is silent on how his aspect will be regulated.

The third ordinance, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act 2020, seeks to apparently provide “competitive alternative trading channels” and to promote “barrier free Interstate and intrastate trade”.

But this Act also impinges on the exclusive legislative power of the state legislatures. It does not appear to address the issues of the farmers enumerated above.

The idea that farmers were previously legally prohibited to sell their produce except in mandis is incorrect, except under some local legislations. Marginal farmers were constrained to sell at mandis near their farms by the force of factors enumerated above and as a consequence of cost and convenience.

It is, therefore, disingenuous to say any legal impediments have been removed. In reality, the creation of unregulated, parallel private points of sale will only ensure that the produce continues to be sold as before — at below the minimum support price and without any government intervention.

Section 15 of the Act debars the jurisdiction of civil courts to look into any dispute; the farmer is left to the illusory right to seek legal determination of a dispute before the SDM in the area where the private mandi is located. Assuming, if a farmer in Haryana sells his produce at a private mandi in Amritsar, then in case of disputes he shall have to approach the mandi in Amristar for redressal.

Naturally, this makes the dispute resolution impossible and meaningless, and would force him to sell at distress rates. He will practically have no wherewithal to seek such resolution.

If the Union government wanted to encourage private players, it could have intervened prior to point of sale to secure legal guarantee of a minimum support price based on scientific input costs factor and a strong regulator at the mandi.

The government may have protected the farmers’ concerns and left the rest to be privately negotiated between the purchasers and farmers. This would have met the interest of both the farmers and purchasers.

Since the new regime envisaged a drastic change from the past, the Union government may also think to provide for a regulator to ensure fair play, correct inspection of crops for sale, widen crop insurance, prevent hoarding, collect data on production outputs, farmers’ incomes and to study the effect of the new regime on corporate sponsors and on the ultimate consumer.

There are concerns that a government- or regulator-backed minimum support price will lead to inflation in prices of food items. This proposition is often accepted without analysis and may be scrutinised for its veracity.

For example, the Union government announced minimum support price for low grade paddy at Rs 1,815 per quintal. The price of rice in retail in Delhi was about Rs 4,000 per quintal. Surely, mechanisms need to be augmented to work within these margins for the benefit of farmers, corporate interests and the final consumers.

The effect of the three legislations run contrary to the logic of open, robust and balanced markets, and do not address the established historical issues plaguing the agri-market. These legislations may have terrifying ramifications for food security and are likely to adversely affect consumers.

It is a complex issue that the Union government may have to address in the future as the enactments are actually implemented.

799063,Indian agriculture is under an invisible emergency,"At a time when farmers strive to get the right price for crops, more money in their hands can help reignite the country's economy

In 2019, three weeks after the kharif harvesting season began, reports emerged that farmers are selling their produce at a price way below the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government. Except for a few crops like paddy and maize, market prices for most of the 14 kharif crops, including moong, urad, tur, nigerseeds, bajra, jowar, ragi, cotton, soya bean and sunflower, dropped 8-37 per cent below MSP.

While farmers incurred massive losses, the news did not trigger much outrage among the middle class. The reason is simple: If food prices remain low, household budget remains intact. In fact, the government got a pat on the back for keeping food inflation under control, and nobody really bothered to know what happens to those farmers who produce that cheaper food.

This has not happened for the first time. In 2018 and 2019, farmers have been selling pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals at prices 20 to 30 per cent lower than MSP and demanding procurement of crops they bring to mandis. Even for wheat and rice, which enjoy assured procurement, they have been unable to get a price on a par with MSP, except at places like Punjab and Haryana where a vast and efficient procurement network exists.

But with the World Trade Organization breathing down its neck and autonomous liberalisation in progress, India is under tremendous pressure to dismantle the procurement network.

In October 2019, suddenly in the midst of the paddy procurement season, the Karnal district administration in Haryana imposed a ceiling on paddy purchase beyond its quota of 1.35 million tonnes for the season. While no explanation was given, the government appears to be all set to go back on its commitment of buying every grain of wheat and paddy brought to mandi.

In Punjab, the chief minister has reportedly told a meeting of arhtiyas (commissioning agents) that he would not be able to assure that procurement operations next year runs as smoothly as it used to all these years, pointing to a cut in public stockholding limits in future. With granaries overflowing, cutting down on procurement seems to be the policy approach to reduce unmanageable food surplus. But what will happen to the millions who toil to produce bumper harvests?

Farmers throwing tomatoes, potatoes and onions on the streets is a recurring phenomenon. Add to it the denial of rightful price for most agricultural commodities, that too year after year, and the reasons for the continuing agrarian distress becomes all too apparent.

An analysis by Down to Earth magazine in its 16-28 February, 2019 edition shows that a farmer earns only Rs 7,639 from a hectare of wheat against the production cost of Rs 32,644. This is a huge loss of Rs 25,005 per ha. The loss is Rs 36,410 for paddy, Rs 33,688 for maize and Rs 26,480 for arhar.

The government is well aware of this. In its response to an application under Right to Information (RTI), the Department of Agriculture, Haryana, said that MSP for wheat in 2018-19 marketing season was Rs 1,840 per quintal (100 kg) against the estimated production cost of Rs 2,074, showing a loss of Rs 234 per quintal. The loss was Rs 830 for quintal of cotton.

While an improved procurement and higher MSP can help alleviate the situation, procurement price appears to be deliberately kept low. For the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), which works out MSP for 23 crops, the mandate is not only to provide an assured price to farmers but also to maintain a balance with international prices so that MSP does not fuel inflation.

The higher the food inflation, the more will be the pressure on industries to raise workers’ wages. This will increase the risk of economic reforms going awry. But what’s worrying is farmers alone are left to bear the burden of keeping food inflation under check.

In 2018, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) conducted a study, which illustrates the staggering cost farmers bear for subsidising food.

According to the study, between 2000-01 and 2016-17, farmers suffered a cumulative loss of Rs 45 lakh crore on being denied the rightful price for their produce. This is a loss of some Rs 2.65 lakh crore a year, which farmers suffered because of trade restrictions, low prices and huge gaps in marketing policies, including shortfall in assured procurement.

This denial of rightful income increases farmers’ dependence on farm credit, the primary reason for the spate of farm suicides. Though the government has been withholding data related to this after 2016, data with the National Crime Record Bureau shows as many as 318,528 farmers committed suicide between 1995 and 2015.

The continuous slide in real farm incomes — as per NITI Aayog, real farm incomes have grown at less than 0.44 per cent a year between 2011-12 and 2015-16 — also creates conditions that forces farmers, particularly small farmers, to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities, looking for menial jobs. Strangely, migration from rural to urban areas is seen as a sign of economic growth. In fact, the policy emphasis has remained on moving people out of agriculture into the cities which are in need of cheap labour.

799098,The invisibility of gender in Indian agriculture,"Why policy paralysis in granting entitlements to women in agriculture and farm widows needs to be addressed

Over 40,000 farmers had gathered in Delhi from across India on November 20, 2018. Forty-year-old Chandravati from Ghazipur district, Uttar Pradesh, left three of her daughters and a son back in her village to participate in the Kisan Mukti March at the Ram Lila Maidan, forgoing a Rs 120 per day wage rate. Accompanied by her husband and neighbour Manju (35), she, along with 40 other women from her village and adjoining districts, joined the peaceful congregation in the anticipation of being heard by those at the helm of policy making.

Just like Chandravati and Manju, Ramrati Devi (70) and Sumitra Devi (55) endured a 30-hour plus journey from Masauri village in Patna, Bihar. Their demands were simple: to obtain a fair compensation for the paddy crop that got spoilt in 2018, so as to sustain livelihoods.

Around 80,000 farmers will march from Nashik to Mumbai from February 20 to February 27 in continuance to their demands from last year. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, farmer protests increased from 628 in 2014 to 4,837 in 2016, making evident the disenchanted and displaced agricultural workforce of the country.

While farm pressure groups and protests have been an integral part of Indian history owing to deep-rooted structural problems of colonial extraction; manipulative cropping patterns; corporatisation of agriculture; and low investments; recent farmer protests have seen a historical trend emerging — that of, participation of the female labourer, the woman farmer, the farm widow, and the consequent visibility of the hitherto invisible ‘gendered’ problem in agriculture.

The recent trend of recognising the most vulnerable among farming communities, is also in consonance with the recognition of the landless labourer in schemes such as the Odisha government’s Kalia Yojana.

Conspicuous by ‘her’ absence

Globally more than 400 million women engage in farm work, although they lack equal rights in land ownership in more than 90 countries. Women worldwide engage in non-mechanised farm occupations that include sowing, winnowing, harvesting, and other forms of labour-intensive processes such as rice transplantation.

According to Oxfam (2013), around 80 per cent of farm work is undertaken by women in India. However, they own only 13 per cent of the land. Recent statistics released by the University of Maryland and the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER, 2018) state that women constitute over 42 per cent of the agricultural labour force in India, but own less than two per cent of farmland.

Women in agriculture are affected by issues of recognition and in the absence of land rights, female agricultural labourers, farm widows, and tenant farmers are left bereft of recognition as farmers, and the consequent entitlements.

The root of the problem begins at the official lack of recognition of the female agricultural worker, and the resultant exclusion from rights and entitlements, such as institutional credit, pension, irrigation sources, etc. According to the India Human Development Survey (IHDS, 2018), 83 per cent of agricultural land in the country is inherited by male members of the family and less than two per cent by their female counterparts.

In the absence of any recognition, women such as Chandravati, Manju, Ramrati Devi, and Sumitra Devi are left out of entitlements related to access to rural credit, assets, technology, irrigation, and inputs.

Issues in rural ‘Women Land Rights’ (WLR)

In 2011, M S Swaminathan, Rajya Sabha member (2007-13) proposed the ‘Women Farmers Entitlement Bill’, which lapsed in 2013. With increasing recognition being given to the contribution of women in agriculture such as by commemorating the ‘Rashtriya Mahila Kisan Divas’, it is time that such legislations and institutional reform in agriculture are addressed.

According to the general recommendation # 34 of the United Nations (UN) Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, 2014) on the rights of rural women, ‘land rights discrimination is a violation of human rights.’ In the past, several steps have been introduced in this regard, proper implementation of which has remained tardy.

The Hindu Succession Amendment Act (2005) granted coparcenary rights to daughters and equal inheritance rights. The draft of the National Women’s Policy (2016), prepared by the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development recognised the importance of land rights for women.

However, issues related to tenure security, and most importantly, the chasm between land ‘ownership, accessibility to entitlements, and control,’ are important challenges affecting the economic empowerment of women in agriculture. One example here is that of proxy sarpanches or ‘sarpanchpatis,’ where the control is often vested with the husband of the elected woman representative under the aegis of Panchayati Raj Act (1993).

According to Bina Aggarwal (1993), a number of factors constrain women in exercising their legal rights including patrilocal post-marital residence, village exogamy, opposition to mobility from men, traditionally institutionalised gender roles, low female literacy and awareness, male dominance in administrative, judicial, and other public decision-making bodies at all levels.

It should be noted that low awareness about women’s right to land aggravates the magnitude of the problem. Additionally, reluctance of women to avoid any conflict with male members of the family and relatives are other factors that inhibit accessibility to agricultural land to women.

Aggravating the issues further is the improper maintenance of land records, poor management of data, and limited digitisation of land records, which affect implementation of agricultural schemes meant to uplift farmers in general, as such challenges make identification of beneficiaries difficult. For instance, some of these challenges have been pointed out in fairly implementing the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana, announced in Budget 2019.

Farm widows and access to property

Sainath (2014) once quoted, ‘suicide is not about the dead, it is about the living’. Since the advent of liberalisation, more than 300,000 farmers have committed suicide to escape vicious poverty, debt, and humiliation over the past twenty years.

In Maharashtra alone, according to reported statistics (BBC, 2014), there are more than 53,000 farm widows. Out of these, around 10,600 live in Vidarbha, the farmer suicide capital of the country.

Recently, a survey conducted by the Mahila Kisan Adhikar Manch (MAKAAM, 2018) of 505 women farmers (whose husbands committed suicide due to farm crisis) in 11 districts across Marathwada and Vidarbha, found that 40 per cent of women widowed by farmer suicides between 2012 and 2018, were yet to obtain rights of the farmland they cultivated.

Among them, only 35 per cent had secured the rights to their family house. The survey also found that 33 per cent women didn’t know they were entitled to a pension, which makes it evident how women have been excluded from accessing institutional rights and entitlements, in the absence of them being recognised as farmers.

Conclusion

According to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO, 2011), empowering women through land and ownership rights has the potential of raising total agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4 per cent and can reduce hunger across the world by 12-17 per cent.

The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG #5. a.1), seeks to grant property rights and tenure security of agricultural land to women. Policy paralysis in granting entitlements to women in agriculture and farm widows needs to be addressed to empower rural women economically, politically, socially, and psychologically.

The most critical issue that needs to be addressed toward a gendered friendly policy is to minimise the gulf between ownership versus control of land by addressing patriarchal conventions and bottlenecks in interpersonal legislations, to achieve economic equality in gender, as also guaranteed by the Indian Constitution, under the aegis of Article 14.",0
799378,Suicidal thoughts among farmers can be triggered because of non-agricultural problems as well',"A new study is focusing on identifying vulnerable farmers in Punjab, Maharashtra and Telangana, the three states that experience high rate of suicide

In India, farmer suicide is an issue that has been talked about widely. The cases of farmers’ suicide rose by 42 per cent between 2014 and 2015. In 2015, one farmer committed suicide every hour. The latest report of the National Crime Bureau (NCB) shows that around 6,867 farmers committed suicides in 2016.

Meenakshi Sushma speaks to Harprit Kaur, head of the Psychology Department in Punjabi University, about a research project initiated by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) to address farmer suicides.

What is the goal of the study?

Our focus is on the psychological reasons behind farmer suicides. The main goal of the project is to empower farmers. For this study, Punjab Agricultural University has teamed up with Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, Hyderabad and Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Krishi Vidyapeeth at Parbhani, Maharashtra.

Why do you think farmer suicides need to be addressed from a psychological perspective?

Till now, farmer suicides have always been linked to droughts, crop production, loans and debts. But the reasons could be something else also. The team wants to find out general psychological factors leading to suicides. They are not focusing on traditional factors as mentioned earlier. For example, famer X and farmer Y both are in debt and they have same land size, crop type and crop production. Even the amount of loan borrowed is also same. But farmer X might have more suicidal thoughts than farmer Y.

We are adopting a holistic approach by considering the psychological state of an individual. These suicidal thoughts can be triggered because of non-agricultural problems as well. Every time a farmer commits suicides, people conclude that the cause was drought or crop failure. So, this is why it is very important to study their psychology.

Where is the study taking place and what is the methodology involved?

The first step is to identify distressed farmers in villages from three states: Maharashtra, Telangana and Punjab. The study is focusing on these states because they experience high rate of suicide. Using household health survey as a tool, farmer households will be surveyed. Then a peer support volunteers will be set up. These volunteers are rural educated youth. They will be trained by the team headed by me and Sarabjeet Singh, professor of agriculture journalism, language and culture at PAU. These volunteers will go through a series of training process. Psychological modules, developed by referring successful training modules and WHO’s standard psychological module, will be used as a tool to train them.

The counseling will be done in two levels: in the first level the vulnerable farmers will be identified, and in the second level, after a gap of six months—another round of counseling will be done to understand changes in the psychological behavior. The village primary health care centres (PHC) are also a part of the project. Some of the PHCs have volunteered and only those will be trained. Training will be provided through workshops. Psychological first aid will be provided by both PHC and peer support volunteers, during some emergency cases.

Till now, pilot straining programmes for PHC and peer support volunteers has taken place. We have got feedback, based on which we are trying to keep the modules simpler so that people don’t find it difficult to understand. These modules are being developed in all the three local languages: Marathi, Punjabi and Telugu.

What will be the possible impacts of this research and can this be scaled up to all the parts of India?

It is an intervention-based research and the team is also planning to standardise the procedure of the current study. Yes, using the same methods, it can be replicated in other parts of India. Our team is also planning for the same.",0
798812,Samyukt Kisan Morcha ‘suspends’ farm protests after letter from Centre,"Farmers at Singh, Tikri and Ghazipur will start vacating the sites December 11, according to Samyukt Kisan Morcha

The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), which has been spearheading the farmers’ protests for over a year against the now-repealed farm laws, decided December 9, 2021 to “suspend” the protests, after intense negotiations between it and the central government.

The leaders said farmers would vacate the borders of Delhi December 11. However, the SKM also warned that it could resume the protest if the Centre backtracked from its promises.

“We have decided to suspend our agitation. We will hold a review meeting January 15. If the government doesn’t fulfil its promises, we could resume our protest. There will be monthly review meetings,” Gurnam Singh Chaduni, member of SKM, said.

Yogendra Yadav, the leader of the Swaraj Abhiyan Party, also clarified that the farmers will keep an eye on the actions of the government.

“Governments are not trustworthy. We will keep an eye. For now, the border areas and all places like toll plazas which were gheraoed, will be vacated from December 11,” he said.

The sit-in at Delhi’s border areas of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur started November 26, 2020, after the three contentious farm laws were passed.

The Union government was forced to repeal the laws after a year-long continuous movement by the farmers, especially from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.

The SKM said in a statement:

Samyukt Kisan Morcha formally announces the lifting of the morchas at Delhi’s borders on national highways and various other locations in response. The current agitation stands suspended. The battle has been won and the war to ensure farmers’ rights, especially to secure minimum support price (MSP) as a legal entitlement for all farmers, will continue.

The SKM’s decision came after it received a final letter from the government December 9, agreeing to all its demands.

The government said a committee to discuss MSP will be formed to make it more effective. The SKM will list out its members in the panel. The government also said that the ongoing MSP policy will continue.

The letter further said the state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have decided to take back cases filed against farmers during the protest immediately.

Cases filed by Union government agencies will also be withdrawn and the government will appeal to other state governments also to do the same.

The Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab governments have also given in-principle approval to give compensation to the kin of those who lost their lives during the year-long protest.

Some 715 farmers have died in the last one year, according to the SKM.

“SKM dedicates the fabulous and historic victory of the struggle to around 715 martyrs of the movement, including those in Lakhimpur-Kheri. SKM congratulates all the protesting farmers and citizens and their supporters wholeheartedly for waging an unprecedented struggle and for the glorious gains of the movement,” the SKM statement said.

The government has also agreed to first discuss the Electricity (Amendment) Bill with the stakeholder groups and the SKM and then present it in Parliament. There will also be no criminal liability to farmers in cases of stubble burning.

Yadav called it the biggest day for farmers. “Now, no prime minister or state government will think of messing with farmers,” he said.

The SKM said celebratory rallies will also be taken out December 11.

“Considering that the nation is mourning the demise of Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat and others, SKM decides to postpone all celebrations with regard to the victory of farmers. Celebratory rallies will be taken out day after tomorrow (December 11) now, when farmers leave the morcha sites together,” the statement said.",0

""We have got written assurance from the government that they will fulfil our demands. Therefore, we are calling off the protest.""BKU (Ekta Ugrahan) state secretary Shangar Singh Mann said, “The minister also assured us of no action against the farmers over stubble burning but appealed us for efforts in reduction of stubble burning as government had planned to put more efforts and promote industry consuming paddy crop residue. The government has also assured of appropriate compensation for cattle died due to lumpy skin disease. The agriculture minister has claimed that already central government has been requested to increase per cattle death compensation amount from Rs 30000 to one lakh. Besides, we have been assured of appropriate compensation to farmers for land aquisition for Bharat mala project, compensation for damaged crops and Girdawari of the recently damaged crops and other demands.”",0
798940,Delhi farmers’ protests: Talks prove inconclusive; next meeting January 8,"Centre reiterates intention to have discussions clause by clause but farmer leaders refuse, leading to rescheduling

The four-hour-long seventh round of talks between the central government and farmer leaders at Vigyan Bhawan in New Delhi January 4, 2020 remained inconclusive yet again. Another meeting has been fixed for January 8.

The agenda of the meeting was to discuss the two foremost demands of the farmers — discussing modalities of repealing the laws and providing a legal guarantee on minimum support price.

These are two of the four items from the talks that resumed December 30. That is when the other two demands to by the Centre.

These were exclusion from penal provisions for burning stubble under the Commission for The Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance, 2020 and changes in the Electricity Amendment Bill 2020.

Monday was the 38th day of the protest by tens of thousands of farmers on the borders of Delhi.

During the meeting, the Centre reiterated its intention to have discussions clause by clause but farmer leaders refused. That is when the next meeting was fixed for January 8.

The discussions were held in a cordial atmosphere, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar told reporters after the meeting. “But since farmers were adamant on the demand of repeal of the three laws, no decision could be reached,” he said. “I feel there will be a solution soon,” he added.

On the other hand, farmer leaders said the protest won’t stop till their demands are met. “We will not go home until the laws are withdrawn,” Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) said.

“The government is under tremendous pressure. We all said this is our demand (repeal of the laws). We don’t want discussion on any other topic except for on repeal of the laws. Protests will not be withdrawn until repeal of laws,” Hannan Mollah, general secretary, All India Kisan Sabha, said.

During the meeting, Tomar, Union Minister for Railways Piyush Goyal and Minister of State for Commerce Som Parkash, along with government officials and farmer leaders, observed a two-minute silence for farmers who died during the ongoing protest.

So far, around 60 farmers have lost their lives during the protest, according to Tikait.

A seven-member coordination committee representing the Samyukta Kisan Morcha had issued an ultimatum to the central government January 2 to repeal the three controversial farm laws or face a series of protests and sit-ins.

These included a country-wide awareness campaign “to expose the government and its farm policies” and a tractor-trolley march in Delhi January 26 to observe a “Farmers’ Republic Parade Day”.

The protesters plan to burn copies of the three farm laws on the occasion of Lohri January 13.",0
796917,"‘Govt is cheating us, destroying traditional agriculture’","Farmers living in tribal areas in Jharkhand alleged that industrialists and the government are conspiring to ruin diverse traditional seeds and crops

Farmers from Jharkhand’s Singhbhum district, a tribal area, alleged that the government and industrialists are trying to destroy their traditional knowledge of agriculture and looting cultivable land.

This happened on the last day of a conference held on ‘Traditional agriculture: challenges and possibilities’ at Chaibasa this month. These farmers belonged to Gangaram Kalundia Forum, named after a leader who was murdered in 1982 while fighting for the villagers’ fundamental rights against displacement.

“Much-acclaimed increase in agricultural production during green revolution was the result of proper irrigation facilities and an increase in agricultural land. On the other hand, dams built in the name of irrigation have actually been built for the benefit of the corporate houses,” read a declaration released by the farmers.

They further alleged that the Centre’s and the state government’s “propaganda” about farmers adopting advanced seeds by introducing high-yielding and hybrid seeds is to destroy their “rich treasure of diverse traditional seeds and crops”.

According to the declaration, “Millions of seeds, which were the basis of our food sovereignty and biodiversity, are lost forever. By stripping farmers of lands in the name of alleged development and depriving us of our food sovereignty and corresponding nutritional security, our constitutionally protected right to life is under attack.”

The farmers have demanded that gram sabhas be allowed to develop and promote traditional agriculture, knowledge on integrated farming be spread, traditional seeds be conserved, traditional farming practices be given preferences and village societies be given control over forests under the Forest Rights Act 2006.

They also want the government to reject amendments to Jharkhand's tenancy laws like Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act, and to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 to ensure no acquisition of cultivable land.",0
797771,"Wheat Crisis: Government procurement goals not met, food security risk increases","Wheat is being purchased at a higher rate than the MSP despite the export ban

The wheat crisis that started earlier this year, is on despite the Centre and states’ efforts, with governments not being able to procure wheat to improve food security. The Centre could procure 18.8 million tonnes (MT) of wheat till June 19, 2022. Punjab had the highest procurement of 9.64 MT, compared to the 13.22 MT that it procured last year. This is the lowest purchase in the past 10 years.

Haryana could only procure 4.2 MT of wheat, compared to 8.5 MT last. Uttar Pradesh recorded the least amount of wheat purchase. It purchased 0.33 MT of wheat this year, compared to 5.6 MT last year.

Madhya Pradesh procured 4.6 MT this year, comparedto 12.8 MT last year. Rajasthan procured just 9,000 tonnes of wheat this year, compared to 2.34 MT last year.

The drastic decline in the government purchase of wheat has been attributed to three main factors. First, traders purchased wheat from farmers at rates higher than the Minimum Support Price (MSP), due to the increase in global wheat prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Second, the intense heat in March and April this year has had an impact on wheat production. And third, the large revenues of the previous year caused a steady shift towards increased mustard cultivation this time, at the cost of wheat.

The UP government took several steps after the state procured low volumes of wheat. But none of them succeeded. The state government also instituted a mobile purchase procedure, informing farmers that officials would visit their villages to buy wheat if they so desired.

However, farmers did not express any interest. The UP government has once again postponed the deadline and will now procure wheat till June 30, 2022.

There is no clear information available about who is buying wheat in Uttar Pradesh. This is because local Arhtiyas (middlemen) contact farmers and offer them prices over the MSP. Moreover, payment is made as soon as the wheat is picked up, whereas a farmer is paid within five to ten days after selling the wheat at a government centre.

Bhartiya Kisan Union (Apolitical) spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said traders started buying wheat from farmers at a higher price after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the government banned all exports later.

Due to this, traders stopped buying from the farmers and the price fell below the MSP. Following this, traders started buying wheat again at a higher price, which eventually made farmers to stop selling their wheat to the government.

The administration is still unsure of the expected extent of the decline in wheat output. In February 2022, the government had released the second advance estimate, wherein the country’s production estimate was at 111.3 million tonnes.

However, just 5.6 percent of production was predicted to fall short in the advance estimate analysed in May, although experts predicted a production loss of 15-20 per cent. Malik added that the government needed to be open and honest about its production estimates.

On June 10, 2022, a statement came from the Union Ministry of Food and Public Distribution, initially admitted that despite all governmental efforts, the arrival of wheat for government procurement remained low.

However, the statement soon patted the government on the back, stating that wheat farmers across the country had benefited from higher market rates, as most farmers sold their produce to private traders at a higher market rate than the MSP. This, according to the government, is the main goal of its programme for farmers’ welfare.

The ministry stated, “It was discovered that farmers made more money selling their crop in the open market than they did under MSP this season, with an average selling price of Rs 2,150 per quintal.

“In a similar vein, on an anticipated 44.4 MT purchase, farmers would have made an average of roughly Rs 95,460 crore at Rs 2,150 per quintal, whereas the MSP would have made just Rs 89,466 crore at the cost of Rs 2,015 per quintal. Therefore, the wheat farmers would have earned a total of Rs 5,994 crore more than the MSP,” it added.

Food security, however, is at risk since government procurement has not been done. Initially, the government had planned to buy 44.4 MT of wheat during this Rabi season. But with farmers selling their wheat to merchants and the extreme heat in March, wheat production reduced.

As a result, the government changed its plan. The procurement target during the current marketing season was amended to 19.5 MT in the first week of May. Roughly 18.8 MT of wheat have been purchased so far, falling short of this objective as well.",0

Hyderabad High Court orders to shut the Gaddi Annaram market on Tuesday morning, which was reopened three days ago. The HC directed to close the market till April 6.

Earlier, the traders approached the HC and complained that the police officials resorted to lathi-charge on them when they tried to stop the officials from closing the market, following which the court directed to reopen the market.

The officials have also shifted the fruits that arrived in lorries to Bata Singaram.

The traders staged a protest demanding the officials to reopen the market and questioned how could they shut down the market disobeying the high court orders.

One of the trader said that the place at the Bata Singaram where the market is temporarily arranged is insufficient for the traders as there are around 95 traders including farmers at the place currently.",0
798840,Bihar to give subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate crops due to waterlogging,"It has approved Rs 550 crore for farmers whose standing crop was damaged this monsoon season

The Bihar government has announced compensation for farmers who could not even sow this Kharif season as large tracts of agricultural land remained under water due to excessive monsoon rainfall. The general practice has been to compensate only those who lose standing crops due to bad weather — floods, droughts, etc.

The Bihar cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar October 11, 2021 approved Rs 550 crore for farmers whose standing crop was damaged this monsoon season. It has also, in a first, earmarked Rs 100 crore in farm subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate on their land due to waterlogging.

Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary in the Cabinet, said the decision to provide agriculture input subsidy to farmers for their standing crop damage is not new; that it will give farm subsidy to all farmers who could not cultivate on their land is.

“The subsidy will be given on the basis of ground assessment carried out by the district officials concerned,” Kumar said.

Harendra Yadav, a marginal farmer from Muzaffarpur district, said: “For the first time the government has decided to take care of farmers like me who could not use their farmland for cultivation. It is a big relief.”

Yadav is one of thousands of farmers affected by waterlogging since mid-June.

The government decision will help farmers, mainly the small and marginal ones, said RK Sohane, agriculture scientist and vice-chancellor, Bihar Agriculture University, Bhagalpur.

“This will help small and marginal farmers to invest in Rabi crops,” he added.

He added the government agencies can easily identify farmers who could not use their land for cultivation due to waterlogging by using remote sensing data. Besides, the kisan salahkar (farmer advisor) at panchayat level will help the government prepare a list of affected farmers.

The standing crop was damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year, according to agriculture department’s assessment.

Repeated floods and surplus rains damaged standing crop across thousands of hectares as farmland were submerged for weeks.",1
798856,Fewer farmers benefited from government procurement last Rabi season,"Government body recommends increasing procurement of foodgrains from Bihar, UP and Rajasthan

Fewer farmers in Punjab benefited under the government scheme of procurement of wheat in the last Rabi season, according to the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), the body mandated to measure the minimum support price.

Government agencies procured a record 43.3 million tonnes, as of July 8, 2021, in the 2021-22 Rabi marketing season. This benefited 4.92 million farmers, around twice the number in 2016-17.

Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan were the two states with high wheat production that recorded an increase in the number of farmers covered under the government procurement scheme. According to CACP data, the number of farmers covered increased from nearly 1.6 million in 2020-2021 to 1.72 million in 2021-2022 in Madhya Pradesh.

Rajasthan witnessed a marginal increase in coverage of farmers: To 0.23 million in 2021-2022 from 0.22 million farmers in 2020-2021.

This number came down in Punjab: To 0.8 million from 1 million over the same period, according to CACP report titled Price Policy for Rabi Crops: The Marketing Season 2022-23.

The report carries details of the state of affairs of agriculture production, costs and trade. Based on this report’s recommendations, the government approves the minimum support price for crops.

On September 8, the government declared the minimum support prices for the mandated six Rabi crops: Wheat, barley, gram, lentil, rapeseed and mustard and safflower.

Three states — Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar — have 23.6, 10.3 and 6.3 per cent of the marketed surplus of wheat in the country. Currently, they don’t have a proportionate share in government procurement of wheat, even though in recent years the number has been on the rise.

CACP recommended that procurement scheme should focus on these states instead of Punjab and Haryana, where it could be hitting a plateau.

The CACP report added:

“While procurement in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana is much higher than their share in total marketed surplus, wheat procurement in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar is much lower than their shares in total marketed surplus and production. The commission, therefore, recommends that efforts be made to strengthen and bring more farmers under procurement operations in these States to reap the benefits of support prices and help enhance their income levels.”

It added that to ensure remunerative prices to farmers in these states, the commission recommends strengthening of procurement operations by opening more procurement centres, creating storage infrastructure and creating awareness amongst farmers in vernacular / schedule languages by states.",1
798909,"International Women’s Day: 50,000 women farmers join protest at Singhu and Tikri","Women farmers have repeatedly expressed their acute concern over the last three months, about how the three farm laws will affect their lives

Around 50,000 women farmers joined their male counterparts at Singhu and Tikri on the borders of Delhi March 8, 2021 to celebrate their unique and long-standing participation in India’s largest farmers’ protest.

Women cultivators and agricultural labourers perform 70 per cent of all agricultural activities, according to a report published by international coalition of non-profits, Oxfam International.

Yet, their contribution is invisibilised and they are not acknowledged as farmers, according to the report. Despite their marginal status within the agricultural sector, women’s contribution to the ongoing farmers’ protests remains unprecedented and they are fulfilling multiple roles and responsibilities within the movement.

“The way women have lent support to the ongoing farmers’ protests deserves to be celebrated. The whole world today is celebrating their contribution and the recent TIME magazine cover dedicated to women farmers is only one example of that,” Navsharan Kaur, from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, said.

“Several revolutionary slogans from within Punjab have also emerged that convey women’s commitment to the ongoing movement. One slogan among them is: bacha bacha jhok denge zamin pe karza rok denge (We will feed the furnace of revolution with our children. We will pay back the dues to the land),” Kaur added.

Women farmers have repeatedly expressed their acute concern over the last three months, about how the three controversial farm laws will affect their lives.

Kuljeet Kaur from Samyukt Kisan Morcha shared, “These three laws threaten to completely ruin our lives, our homes and our kitchens. When farmers don’t have money, how will they send their daughters to schools? It is a matter of our collective future,” she said.

Even though the key demand of women farmers remains the repeal of the three farm laws, as well as an assurance of minimum support prices, several other issues about women’s working conditions in the field were raised during the women’s day celebration.

“Whenever we talk about Women’s Day, we cannot ignore the fact that the largest number of women counted as workers are from agriculture. Women farmers at Singhu and Tikri are actively talking about sexual harassment, issues of Dalit landless women and women’s access to education and health-related facilities,” Kavita Kuruganti of ASHA Kisan Swaraj said.

Several women farmers are also demanding the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report that suggested that farmers should have assured access to and control over basic resources such as land, water, credit and insurance.

Women farmers and organisers have also demanded the release of all women political prisoners including the activists arrested in the Bhima Koregaon case.

They are actively extending support to several other people-based movements that are resisting several oppressive laws brought in by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government.",1
798958,International Day of Rural Women: A day in the life of a tribal woman farmer in Odisha,"Anita Naik, a farmer living near Similipal National Park, has become an entrepreneur after turning to maize instead of leaving uplands fallow

Over 70 per cent of rural women in India are engaged in agriculture. Women carry out a large portion of the farm work as cultivators and agricultural labourers. Yet, in most instances, they are not even counted and recognised as farmers.

Millions of rural Indian women also shoulder the domestic work burden, a job that is undervalued and unrecognised economically. The contributions of these women, often overlooked, play a pivotal role in creating food security that sustains rural communities.

Farmer Anita Naik is one such woman in rural India. On the International Day of Rural Women (October 15), we should recognize the contributions of millions of rural farmers like her.

A day in her life

Farmer Anita Naik hails from the village of Badbil in the Mayurbhanj district of Odisha. The village is surrounded by small hills and the lush greenery of the Similipal National Park.

“The day is short and so much still needs to be done at home and in the field,” Anita says after toiling from early morning till evening. Anita, 41 years old, belongs to a tribal community that has long lived off the land through farming and rearing livestock.

Smallholder farmers like her have been growing rice, maize and vegetables in traditional ways (often labour-intensive with limited yield) to ensure food for their families.

Anita was married at a young age. She has a son and a daughter. Her husband and her son are daily wage labourers.

But the uncertainty around their jobs and her husband’s chronic ill-health means that she shoulders most of the responsibilities of her family’s well-being. Short and lean, with a stoic expression, Anita’s age belies the experience that a life of endless struggle brings.

Anita begins her day just before dawn, a little past 4 am, with household chores. After letting out the livestock animals (goats, cattle, chicken and sheep) for the day, she sweeps the insides of the house, the courtyard and the animal shed.

She then lights the wood stove to prepare tea for herself and her family, who are slowly waking up to the sound of the crowing rooster.

Anita feeds the animals, helped by her young daughter and then cleans up the dirty dishes from last evening., She starts preparing for the morning and afternoon meals around 6.30-7 am.

During the lean months, when farm work is not pressing, Anita works as a daily wage earner at a fly ash bricks factory about two kilometers away from her house.

She says the extra income helps her cover costs during emergencies and that she finds it difficult to “stay idle if I am not working on the farm.”

However, the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions since last year have affected this source of income for the family.

Once her morning household chores are over, Anita works on her small farmland adjoining her house, where she cultivates maize and grows vegetables primarily for household consumption.

Anita started cultivating maize only after joining a self-help group (SHG) in 2014 that helped her and other women cultivate hybrid maize for commercial production on leased land.

They were supported by the Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia project’s (CSISA) maize intensification programme.

Every year from June to October, apart from cultivating maize her own land, Anita works on this leased farmland, from the sowing of the crop to its harvesting and even its marketing with other members.

A little further away from her house, Anita has another small piece of land where she grows paddy with the help of her husband and son.

After checking in on her maize crop on the leased land, Anita works in the paddy fields the rest of the day.

During paddy cultivation, a woman’s primary role is to remove the weeds. Anita tends to her land diligently, intent on removing the weeds that keep springing up again and again in the monsoon season.

“It is back-breaking work, but I have to do it myself as I cannot afford to employ a labourer,” laments Anita.

Anita finally takes a break around 1 pm for lunch, after some hours of work in the paddy field. On some days, particularly in summers, when exhaustion takes over, she takes a short nap before getting back to removing weeds in the paddy fields.

After hours spent bending to clear the weeds, she finally heads home around 4 pm. At home, she first takes the animals back into their shed.

Close to around 6 pm, she starts preparing for dinner. After dinner, she clears the kitchen and the woodstove before calling it a night and going to bed around 8-9 pm.

Tomorrow is a new day, but chores at home and the work in the fields continue for Anita and farmers like her who selflessly go about their life.

Transforming women’s lives

Traditionally, farmers in and around Anita’s village cultivated paddy in their small uplands for personal consumption only, leaving the land fallow for the rest of the year.

Growing rice is quite taxing as paddy is a labour-intensive crop involving sowing, irrigating, weeding and harvesting. Yields can vary and are often low due to limited resources, lack of awareness and appropriate machinery.

The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center’s (CIMMYT) CSISA project (Cereal Systems Initiative for South Asia) facilitated maize cultivation for farmers, such as those in Anita’s village.

The aim was for them to make maximum use of the land all year-round and to move beyond personal consumption towards commercial production.

CIMMYT’s CSISA project began its sustainable intensification programme in some parts of Odisha’s plateau region in early 2012.

During the initial phase, maize stood out as an alternative crop with a high level of acceptance, particularly among women farmers.

Wasim Iftikar, research associate at CIMMYT (CSISA Odisha), said:

CSISA started working in four districts — Mayurbhanj, Nuapada, Bolangir, and Keonjhar – together with various state, private, and civil society actors to help catalyse the adoption of maize production in the region. At present, maize cultivation has been adopted by 7,600 farmers, of which 28 per cent are women farmers in these four districts.

Today, women like Anita Naik have established themselves as successful maize farmers and entrepreneurs. In 2020, despite COVID19 disruptions, Anita’s SHG made a profit of Rs 66,000 from green cobs and Rs 45,000 from dry grain selling.

Many of these women were also the only breadwinners after the COVID19 crisis hit the employment of male members in the family. As more and more farmers adopt maize cultivation with better agronomic practices, their stories of success are just beginning to unfold.

799019,Changes in South Africa’s rainfall seasons could affect farming and water resources,"Trends across different rainfall zones demonstrated patterns that can be linked to changes recorded for large-scale climate systems, the study found

Most of South Africa’s seasonal rainfall occurs during the warmer summer months, from October to March. As a result, October is an important period for farmers to begin planning when to sow crops (such as maize, wheat and sunflowers) for the growing season.

October is also an important period for the tourism industry to think about water supplies for the upcoming summer holiday season.

The timing of summer rainfall, and all rainfall across South Africa, is determined by large-scale climate systems. Climate change is gradually changing the location of these systems and their moisture corridors, which bring rainfall to each region.

The southward shift in the westerly winds (one of these large-scale climate systems) and their mid-latitude cyclones is one of the reasons Cape Town suffered such a severe water shortage between 2015 and 2017.

Research shows that the record low rainfall amounts were caused by recent expansion of the Hadley cell, the circulation of air from the tropics to subtropics.

This expansion has changed the timing of summer rainfall and caused intensification of high-pressure systems (causing dry conditions), and a southward shift of the westerly wind belt (providing moisture for winter cold front rainfall).

South Africa has distinct spatial zones of rainfall seasonality. These are termed the summer-, winter- and year-round rainfall zones. Eastern and central regions get their rainfall during the summer months.

That’s when the southwestern Cape and west coast regions are dry due to strong high-pressure conditions. In winter, the high-pressure systems shift north, sitting across the interior of the country and causing dry conditions there. The southern coast and a strip of land between the summer and winter rainfall zones form the year-round rainfall zone.

Most research in South Africa has focused on how large-scale climate system changes are influencing rainfall totals. Little research has considered consequent changes in rainfall seasonality — the timing of rainfall, including when the wet season begins and ends.

These changes are important to consider, because rainfall seasonality changes across South Africa may have detrimental impacts on crop yields and surface water supplies. This prompted our research, recently published in the International Journal of Climatology.

We used rainfall and temperature records between 1987 and 2016 from 46 weather stations across South Africa to calculate annual rainfall seasonality characteristics using two methods.

These quantify the strength of seasonality, and the wet-season start- and end-dates, length, total rainfall amount, number of rain days and rainfall intensity. We then explored how these characteristics changed during 1987-2016. We chose this recent 30-year period because that’s when climate change impacts have begun to show.

The hope is that this information can inform effective adaptation in sectors and activities dependent on rainfall seasonality characteristics. This is because, if sustained, the trends we calculated present a concerning outlook for continued crop production and water resource management.

What we found

As rainfall varies considerably over the years and decades, we didn’t expect to find any conclusive evidence of rainfall seasonality changes over this relatively short period. But we did find that the trends across the different rainfall zones demonstrate patterns which can be linked to changes recorded for large-scale climate systems.

Our calculations reveal that the wet season started later and produced less rainfall across the interior summer rainfall zone and adjacent interior year-round rainfall zone.

This is linked to Hadley cell expansion, which is associated with the tropical rain belt taking moisture south later. For the eastern coastal locations, the summer wet season started earlier, but also produced less rainfall. This can similarly be linked to Hadley cell expansion, but more strongly to changes in the high-pressure systems transporting moisture from the Indian Ocean.

The strongest trend signal for winter rainfall locations, and adjacent interior year-round rainfall locations, reflects reduced wet-season totals. This is consistent with a poleward shift of the westerlies, linking to less rainfall associated with cold fronts.

The most consistent trend for the southern coast year-round locations was for a longer dry season with increased wet-season rainfall. These trends are complicated to interpret, but can be linked to changes in the westerlies and high-pressure systems.

Why it matters

The trends we calculated are concerning, especially those of wet-season drying. Should these continue, activities that depend on rainfall could experience severe impacts. We’ve already seen this during the Cape Town “day zero” drought — and events like this are expected to occur more frequently in the decades to come.

Agriculture, for instance, relies on the wet-season timing, its length and total rainfall to dictate when to sow crops, and to select appropriate crops which will mature before the wet season ends. Later wet-season start dates and less rainfall will require additional planning and farmers will need to select crops that can be sown later and will fully mature with less rainfall.

Water resource managers also rely on rainfall seasonality characteristics to adequately manage use of water supplies. With many trends reflecting less wet-season rainfall, this would similarly require additional planning and monitoring to make sure water supplies do not run dry.

Going forward

Our research identified many consistent trends which can already inform management strategies for rainfall dependent activities. But there’s a need to explore similar trends for longer periods, across more areas of the country.

It’s important to develop future scenarios considering rainfall seasonality changes and the mechanisms that drive trends. Among others, farmers, water managers and climatologists will need to closely monitor rainfall seasonality characteristics during coming years.

In addition to synthetic chemistries, the pipeline also boasts a growing portfolio of bioinsecticides, biofungicides, bionematicides and biostimulants.

Best New Biological Product (Biostimulant)

FMC won the Best New Biological Product (Biostimulant) category with its Accudo® biostimulant, a microbial innovation valued for enhancing yield gains greater than 15 percent. It enhances root development and has anti-fungal tolerance, delivering superior yield increases compared to competitive products. Accudo® biostimulant also has a superior shelf life of two years compared to competitive biological crop protection products on the market.

Best New Marketing Program – Commended

FMC was commended by the judges for its marketing campaign using augmented reality for Talstar® insecticide in cotton applications. The campaign allowed the FMC Pakistan sales team to create an opportunity for farmers to visualize the deleterious effects of various crop pests on their cotton fields and then demonstrate the efficacy of Talstar® insecticide in a powerful virtual format.",1
799381,Farmer companies have triggered changes globally',"Roberto Logo, a specialist on farmer organisations and markets with a UN agency, on the development of corporate partnerships with Farmer Producer Companies across the globe

Farmer producer companies (FPCs) were conceptualised in 2001 by the late Verghese Kurien. He created the milk cooperative Amul, but later realised cooperatives were vulnerable to political influence.



In 2002, the National Democratic Alliance government led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee enacted the Producer Companies Act. The government’s objective “was to formulate a legislation that would enable incorporation of cooperatives as companies and conversion of existing cooperatives into companies, while ensuring that the unique elements of the cooperative business remain intact. As per the 2002 Act, all FPCs are registered with the Union Ministry of Corporate Affairs.



They are a part of the post-liberalisation policy of the country in view of the decreasing landholding size and the missing link between raw materials and corporates. Similar initiatives have been witnessed outside India, too. While the cooperative model does not seem effective in the agriculture sector, FPCS have shown promise.

Logo, a senior technical specialist on farmer organisations and markets with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) talks to Down To Earth about FPCS and how they can become sustainable.

How do Farmer Producer Companies (FPCs) function in Africa?



IFAD formed one umbrella organisation— Farmers' Forum— in 2005 to promote farmer organisations across the world. It is the overall framework of the partnership between IFAD and these organisations, which are run by smallholder farmers. The forum facilitates a permanent process of consultation between these producer organisations, IFAD and governments, focusing on rural development and poverty reduction. It is an ongoing, bottom-up dialogue between these parties.



How has been the experience of promoting FPCs in Africa?



Experience is positive. Our forum is in either collaboration with farmers' organisations or in tripartite collaboration. We promote capacity building, like linkages to markets, create collaboration with the banking sector for loan or guarantee. It is positive that financial institutions are coming out in support for lending to these organisations.



How has the International Fund for Agricultural Development brought changes on the ground?



We have helped in developing toolkit to take stock of the situation. IFAD has been executing 240 development projects across the globe. There are many examples how it has triggered changes. It is difficult to give the numbers of warehouses, market outlets, and the value chains created in Liberia, Congo, Madagascar, and in other east and west African countries. There are various examples. We do not have numbers regarding FPCs.



What type of activities are undertaken by such organisations?



This network promotes cooperatives which are controlled and managed by its members. There are several opportunities to promote and train members to develop market linkages between cooperatives and other value chains at national as well as regional levels.



Farmers' Forum has tried to promote inter-regional agri-trade. East African Farmers Federation (EAFF), a forum of east African farmers organisations, pursued a legal framework to promote market linkages among themselves. After years of persuasion such legal frame has been approved by east African countries. Now it is in the process of ratification by member countries.



How can these organisations become sustainable?



They need to keep providing service to their members. They need advisory services, support for direct purchase and selling, infrastructure, like warehousing for stocking when the price is low, and linkages to financial institutions. They also require education for advocacy for their cause. Governments should help these groups in sustaining against developed countries which subsidise their products.

798951,Antimicrobial Awareness Week 2021: How poor regulation threatens aquaculture,"There are no regulations or institutional setup for freshwater aquaculture

Aquaculture is the world’s fastest-developing food production sector and represents an important impediment to food production. Fish are the most-traded food commodity in international trade with an export value of nearly $150 billion (around Rs 11.2 lakh crore).

The globalisation of aquatic animal products and the rise of aquaculture as a primary supplier of the world’s aquatic food supply have led to an intensification of culture practices. This has created new market opportunities for farmed aquatic animals but has simultaneously facilitated the easier spread of pathogens and diseases.

Diseases are a primary constraint to aquaculture and a variety of drugs are used to control the diseases. However, the imprudent use of these drugs in aquaculture is a contributing factor in the spread of anti-microbial resistance (AMR). Continuous use of antibiotics for alleviating bacterial diseases in aquaculture has led to ‘pseudo-durability’ and their omnipresence in the environment, which has caused the development of selective pressure on the microbial community.

Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) formed under selective pressure can develop into an environmental reservoir of antibiotic-resistant genes. Aquaculture systems and fish farms have been observed as the ‘hotspots for AMR genes’ and hence the assessment of resistome, the AMR gene assemblage in aquaculture, is an important topic of research worldwide.

Since the majority of antimicrobials used in aquaculture are also employed in human medicine, their use has a significant impact on the development of AMR in other ecological niches, particularly the human environment. Researchers have reported an increase in the frequency of serious infections and treatment failures as a result of antimicrobial resistance being transferred from aquaculture to humans through the consumption of aquaculture products.

Aquaculture in India, particularly shrimp and carp aquaculture, has been playing a significant role in the agriculture sector. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics are pervasive in both brackishwater and freshwater aquaculture.

The use of aquadrugs is common in major fish-producing states like Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal. The use of antibiotics is slowly rising in states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha.

There are standards, guidelines and an institution to manage the use of antibiotics and pharmacologically active substances in export-oriented brackishwater aquaculture. But there are no regulations or institutional setup for freshwater aquaculture, which account for two-thirds of India's fish production.

In other words, while we are protecting the health of our export customers, we have no concern for domestic consumers.

Besides food-fish production, antibiotics have got large scale applications in ornamental fish production. In recent years, the increased development of ornamental fish culture in many states has opened up problems of disease and water quality deterioration in ornamental fish.

Most of the ornamental fish varieties are normally procured from neighbouring Asian countries to India mainly through legal and illegal means. Ornamental fish have been the source of exotic bacterial and viral pathogens that have mandated strict quarantine regulations.

A wide range of antimicrobials have found their way into Indian ornamental fish culture since there are no strict guidelines in ornamental fish. Most of the aquaculture farmers are small-scale entrepreneurs with farm sizes less than two hectares. This creates a situation where the farmers may not be able to afford the investment needed to install biosecurity measures in farms.

Most of the shrimp farms get their seed from bio-secured hatcheries. However, several antibiotics are used at the time of transport with an erroneous assumption that they can reduce the mortality in seeds during transportation.



Poor regulation

A large part of the antibiotic use is not supervised by any scientific personnel and is generally based on the experience of fellow farmers. The policy of the European Union to reject consignments of shrimp, which has the presence of antibiotic residues has had a definite impact on the use of antibiotics in shrimp aquaculture.

The Marine Products Exports Development Authority is now conducting regular inspections of shrimp products, to ensure that it complies with export standards laid down by various international agencies. But this inspection is confined to the products meant for the export market and those meant for local consumption is largely unregulated.

Farmers have brought down the use of antibiotics through several biosecurity measures. There is very little antibiotic use in cage farming due to the complexity involved in administration. But in aquaculture farming other than shrimp, there is significant use of antibiotics. This is because the products are meant for local consumption and the market is highly unregulated.

In integrated farming, poultry waste and bird droppings are used as fish feeds. This gives rise to a peculiar situation in which there is antibiotic contamination of the aquaculture environment, even without direct use of antibiotics since poultry farming uses a high amount of antibiotics.

Vibrio bacteria has been isolated from coastal aquacultural areas showing a high prevalence of AMR. Aeromonas spp (species plural) depicting multi-drug resistance (MDR) have been isolated from the freshwater aquaculture systems.

The southern states of India, particularly the wetlands of coastal Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, are considered to harbour high levels of ARB. Two-thirds of the samples drawn from fish and shellfish obtained from the markets have Salmonella strains resistant to at least two antibiotics.

These results reflect the poor implementation of the existing legislative provisions, as well as the polypharmacy practised in the aquaculture sector. Such emerging AMR and MDR rates in India are an alarming situation.

The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has placed an extensive ban on the use of antibiotics and several pharmacologically active substances in fisheries. The long-term impact of the use of antibiotics for aquaculture not only has ramifications for the emergence of resistance in indigenous bacteria but also has a yet unmeasured impact on the ecology and the environment.

Due to the existence of stringent legislative provisions to contain the inappropriate and non-therapeutic use of antibiotics, it is expected that the problem of AMR in the aquaculture sector should be smaller compared to other sectors. However, the monitoring and implementation lack a roadmap, making it difficult to form a policy.

There is an absence of a ‘One Health’ approach to AMR containment at a policy level, as the focus is more on human health issues and the scope of the problem in the veterinary and aquaculture sectors, although acknowledged, is not outlined in granular details.

Few regulations and legislative measures are available against the non-therapeutic use of antibiotics in food animals. Limited legislations are available for the control of antibiotics in the livestock sector, although some legislative tools are available for fisheries and poultry raised exclusively for export.

Improving hygiene, using enzymes, probiotics, prebiotics and acids to improve health and utilising bacteriocins, antimicrobial peptides and bacteriophages as substitutes for antibiotics might be good methods to promote fish growth and decrease infectious diseases in them. As of now, stringent monitoring on antimicrobial use in Indian aquaculture is deemed necessary for the betterment of human health and aquaculture.

799293,India cannot afford organic farming,"S K SINHA national professor at the Water Technology Centre, Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, spoke to Manish Tiwari on food security and the future of chemical agriculture in India

Can foodgrain production in India be increased further?

I see no reason why foodgrain production in the country cannot be increased. To think that only Punjab represents the entire country, is wrong. In many areas foodgrain production can be increased by using increased inputs, like fertilisers. We tend to compare the foodgrain production of India with other countries like China. But the amount of fertiliser being used by farmers in China exceeds the amount used in India. For example, the average use of fertilisers in India is around 69 kg per hectare, whereas farmers in China use an average of 366 kg per hectare.



What is the future of chemical farming in India?

There are many areas in India where foodgrain production has not increased even with the use of such inputs. In many countries such as Japan, farmers use around 300 to 400 kg of fertiliser per hectare. It is another matter that climatic conditions in India are very different from Japan. However, such high levels of fertilisers must not be used to increase production. But I do not think that we will ever reach a level where we have to use 400 kg of fertilisers per hectare. But I do believe that even if we use an average of 80 kg per hectare under the prevailing climatic conditions, we will be able to increase our food production.



Can genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) meet the food demand in Asia, particularly in India? Why are people so apprehensive about GMOs?

We must not confuse ourselves by linking the issue of food security with gmo s. How many crops are being grown at present in the world that have been genetically modified? There are only certain crops that are genetically modified such as cotton, soybean and tomatoes. There is still nothing worth talking about gmo s with regard to wheat. There has been some research on rice. At present, not many gmo s have reached the field level.I do not think that gmo s will change the situation of foodgrains in India in another 10 years.



We should not lay too much emphasis on this issue at the cost of other pressing matters. For instance, farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa, are yet to adopt the available technologies in the country. If these technologies are put to use, production in these states will double. But this is not happening. If farmers do not adopt the available technologies, how can we expect them to accept gmo s so readily. I think some organisations may benefit by properly marketing gmo s around the world. However, with cotton and vegetables we need gmo s to reduce the use of pesticides.



With the economy becoming stronger people tend to shift to meat eating. It requires a lot of grain to feed livestock. Therefore, will a change from vegetarian to non-vegetarian food habits affect our foodgrain consumption?

I do not think people in India will ever prefer non-vegetarian food over vegetarian food. In the us and in Europe, people prefer to eat beef and pork. But religion and cultural backgrounds prevent Indians from doing so. Indians are not fond of non-vegetarian food. At best they eat chicken. We did a survey of passengers travelling by Indian Airlines. These were people who could afford non-vegetarian good. But a very large percentage had opted for vegetarian food.



What is wrong with our foodgrain management policy?

The World Food Summit held in 1996 in Rome said there is more than enough food being produced in the world to feed the entire population. Still around 800 million people go hungry. The issue of distribution needs to be managed properly. Today, what is essentially being distributed is the poverty. Even our economists come out with different definitions of poverty. And we are lost in the numbers game. Last year, many economists said that around 40 per cent of India's population are living under the poverty line. Now they are saying that the figure has dropped to 30 per cent.



Can a complete switch to organic farming help us improve the food situation?

I do not think that organic farming in India will ever pick up. We will have to first find out about the sources of organic materials. Whether it is cowdung, organic waste or something else. This is a nice idea, but it is very difficult to implement. There are many countries that can adequately meet their foodgrain requirements. So they can afford to use organic farming. However, we cannot afford to completely bank on organic farming.



Can excessive use of pesticides harm the environment?

Pesticides were allowed in the country to increase foodgrain production. Farmers started using pesticides because they found them useful. Pesticides are being used mostly on cotton, plantation crops and vegetables. But we need to reduce the use of pesticides. It is for this purpose that gmo s should be developed to reduce the use of pesticides. One cannot rule out the use of pesticides in the country if we want to meet the growing food demand.



What do you think is the best way to increase foodgrain production in India without putting too much pressure on the environment?

When people talk about foodgrains, they think they are only talking about food. In fact, the country requires around 250 million tonnes of vegetables and fruits annually. So the real question is how efficiently we can increase our food production, and not foodgrains alone.",0
796714,Compensate Telangana farmers immediately for crop loss: Farm activists,"The Rythu Swarajya Vedika called on both Centre and state, to bury their hatchet and ensure disaster relief to lakhs of affected farmers

The farmers of Telangana have faced unprecedented crop losses in the wake of heavy rains and floods this month. The government should immediately compensate them, an independent farmers’ organisation based in the two Telugu states said July 23, 2022.

Activists of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) also called out the Telangana government’s policies towards farmers.

They addressed a press conference in Hyderabad where they released a factsheet on the claims made by the state and the Centre. The claims dealt with disaster relief, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

The organisation called on both the Centre and state, who have been engaged in a political slugfest, to bury the hatchet and ensure that disaster relief reaches lakhs of affected farmers.

Telangana has been hit by flooding twice in a fortnight now. The first round of flooding happened around July 15 along the Godavari river. On July 22 and 23, heavy rains inundated low-lying areas in Hyderabad and its neighbouring districts such as Medak, Sangareddy and Mahbubabad.

The Met Department has said Telangana is set to get more rains over the next three days. The state’s north and north-eastern districts are set to receive heavy rains and a red alert has been issued for north Telangana districts, Met Department director K Nagaratna told this reporter.

“Up to 20 centimetres of rain is expected in some places. We have given a flood warning for the state. As of now, we have received 119 per cent rainfall and Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts have received highest rains,” she added.

Flawed policies

The RSV expressed concern over extensive damage to cotton, maize, soyabean and red gram crops due to the heavy rains and overflowing waterbodies.

The activists cited preliminary reports of crop damages over 445,154 hectares across the state. They sought immediate enumeration of crops, livestock and lands affected.

They also criticised the government’s lack of data regarding tenant farmers.

“Details of actual cultivators including tenant farmers should be noted down immediately. The Telangana government has refused to implement the Licensed Cultivators Act 2011 and failed to identify lakhs of tenant farmers,” Kiran Vissa, from the RSV, who is in the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said.

“It would be difficult for the government to zero in on tenant farmers and pay compensation in the future if not done soon. Not doing so now would only lead to the government taking the plea of being too late,” he added.

The activists also took exception to giving a go-by to the standard practice of farmer-wise enumeration of crop loss immediately after a disaster.

They said this had led to a handicap even when funds were available. Compensation was provided in 2018 in Adilabad and Khammam districts purely owing to the initiative of the district collectors as they had data and most of the amount went to those districts, the RSV said.

They also highlighted the issue of crop insurance schemes. Telangana exited the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana from the kharif season of 2020.

However, it had failed to establish its own schemes unlike other states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Its farmers thus had not received any compensation despite heavy losses.

Kanneganti Ravi, RSV activist said taking the Telangana government to the High Court for the State of Telangana twice over the past four years over payment of compensation to farmers had not resulted in changing its attitude. In 2018, it was forced to distribute a meagre Rs 23 crore as input subsidy.

“The state went on appeal to the Supreme Court after it lost the case and failed to pay the Rs 188.23 crore for crop losses approved by the Centre between July and September 2021. This despite the state’s crop damage assessment of Rs 552 crore according to the NDRF scale of relief,” Ravi said.

He added that this exposed the claims of generosity by the Centre to the state. “The state government’s failure to fulfil its promise to waive farmers loans has resulted in denial of fresh loans from banks to farmers,” he added.

Telangana has failed to adhere to norms laid down according to guidelines issued in July 2015 and failed to submit reports of expenditure incurred.

Funds according to norms are released by the NDRF, subject to spending of 50 per cent of funds available with the SDRF.

As the SDRF had Rs 977 crore on March 31, 2020 (according to the state accountant general’s letter) and the approved Rs 245.96 crore was less than 50 per cent of the amount, new funds were not released by the Centre. This laid bare, the claim of lack of central assistance for disasters, the RSV factsheet said.

It further said the state government had made mutually contradictory statements in the apex court. It claimed lack of assistance from the Centre despite submission of damages.

At the same time, it said the entire affected crop was recovered completely in October 2020. It thus deduced no need for compensation payment and added that it was too late to identify the farmers now.

This stand has continued despite pronouncements by the state agriculture minister. He had made them after visiting chilli and fruit farmers in Warangal in the aftermath of a hailstorm in January 2022.

Chief Minister K Chandra Sekhar Rao had also seconded this proposal. But farmers are yet to receive any compensation.

The RSV also pooh-poohed the claims of the Telangana government over non-cooperation by the Centre in disbursal of relief funds. They showed a letter from the accountant general to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as proof.

The letter noted the SDRF had a balance of Rs 977 crore on April 1, 2020. It also received Rs 449 crore from the Centre for 2020-21, Rs 149.67 crore from the state for 2020-21 and Rs 10,005 crore diverted from the Telangana Building and Other Workers Welfare Board, which is said to be against established norms.

The RSV said the state should immediately submit its pending accounts for earlier expenditure from SDRF and their current status. If the funds have been spent on Covid pandemic relief, the same should be made public. They also called on the Centre to immediately release full assistance for disaster relief.

Absence of such relief would only add to the growing number of farmer suicides, especially of tenant farmers, B Kondal Reddy, convenor of RSV, said.",0
796823,Onion crisis: ‘High time Union govt invested in low-cost storage’,"Country director, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics talks to DTE on onion price volatality, amendement to Essential Commodities Act, 1955

It is a crisis that repeats itself year after year: A poor yield of onion crop leads to supply crunch — and a sharp spike in its price. The Union government on September 18, 2020 issued a notification prohibiting the export of onions to check the spiralling prices.

Being a key crop, onion often suffers from supply crunch and price volatility.

Arabinda Kumar Padhee, country director, India, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-arid Tropics, spoke to Down to Earth on the price volatility of the crop, inadequate storage facilities and amendment to Essential Commodities Act, 1955 that deregulated several commodities including cereals, pulses, potatoes, onions, among others.

Snigdha Das: Why are onion prices so volatile?

Arabinda Kumar Padhee: India is one of the largest producers as well as consumers of onion across the world. Still, we often see a cycle of onion crisis every second or third year. The reasons ascribed to such situation are many.

Production shocks are, in many instances, related to weather-related events. For example, in late 2019, the excessive rainfall during monsoons damaged the kharif crop, creating shortage of the most important vegetable and spiralling of its price.

Proper crisis management by stakeholder ministries with advance planning is crucial. This is evident from the fact that imported onions in 2019 could not be utilised on time.

Inadequate storage facilities and stock-holding limits fixed by authorities according to the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 are also major reasons for the crisis.

I would like to add another dimension to the problem. As general elections draw closer in any state, the price of onion becomes an issue and policies around it get mired in politics.

SD: Do onions require special storage?

AKP: Yes, indeed. From my own experience as a development practitioner, I would take the inadequate storage structures as the main reason for the demand-supply gap.

As a district collector in a few tribal districts of Odisha, I have seen how even poor and marginalised cultivators keep the little quantity of their surplus harvest in traditional onion storage structures.

It is high time that the Union government promotes and invests in low-cost storage structures as well as private sector investments in post-harvest storage facilities. Significant quantities of onions get wasted for want of good pre- and post-harvest practices.

Buffer stocking by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd and state agencies could stabilise the price situation. Collection of credible data on area and production and market arrivals of onion could inform the policy space better in proper planning.

Farmer producer organisations in the sector could play an important role in the present context.

SD: What do you have to say on the export ban on onions?

AKP: As we speak, the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 has been amended taking onion, potato and few other commodities out of its purview. Imposition of stock limits (to prevent hoarding) have not met desired outcomes in case of onions.

Another thing that the Union government must do to regain confidence of farmers and traders is to lift the ban on the export of onions.

In my view, the ban is regressive and needs rethinking. A stable agri-exports policy would, in fact, be in the larger interest of farming communities. Effective and proactive coordination between stakeholder ministries such as the commerce, agriculture, consumer affairs, etc as well as state governments and trade bodies will be rewarding.

SD: Other countries have promoted cultivars of longer shelf life. Why not India?

AKP: The national agricultural research system, including private sector companies, should intensify efforts for development of new varieties with a longer shelf life and other desired characteristics.

Productivity of onion crop in India, as compared to countries such as China, Egypt and the United States is also quite low. Moreover, production of onion in India is limited to a fewer states. This needs to be diversified to non-traditional areas with specific mission-mode interventions.

SD: What kinds of onions have a longer shelf life — processed or dry?

AKP: Dehydrated onions have longer shelf life and a huge export potential. The Union ministry of food processing industries could incentivise investments in this particular sector for establishment of plants that make dry onions, onion chips or powder, etc. The urban, aspirational sections in India would be a good segment to catch up for such products.",0
797721,Why are Madhya Pradesh farmers throwing away their garlic crops?,"The production of the allium has doubled in the last decade; Chinese, Iranian garlic with larger cloves in greater demand, say farmers

Farmers need to invest a lot of money into producing garlic. However, the market rates right now are the fraction of their investment. Photo: Rakesh Kumar Malviya

There have been several calls to allow garlic export after several video clips on social media showed farmers from Madhya Pradesh throwing out or burning their crops, allegedly over low prices of the allium.

One clip making rounds showed the crop being dumped into a river, while another showed farmers pouring petrol on garlic and setting it on fire in Mandsaur, which has the state’s largest garlic market. Several incidents like these have been reported in Madhya Pradesh in the last few months.

The price of garlic is so low that farmers cannot even recover the money they invested in cultivation, Jagdish Patel told Down To Earth. The farmer from Rajoda village in Dewas cultivates wheat, onion and garlic.

This year, Patel grew garlic on three bighas of land or 0.6 acres. It cost him around Rs 30,000 per bigha of land, meaning he spent around Rs 90,000. Garlic crops require special additives and the fields need to be weeded and graded by hand, which drives up the cost.

Patel’s crop yield was around 4,750 kilogrammes. However, the current market rate for garlic is around Rs 100-150 for 50 kg. “Farmers can’t even recover the cost of tilling the land at these rates,” the farmer told DTE.

The harvest has been slightly low for the last three years but the prices are even lower. The harvest quantity would reach up to 45 quintals per acre earlier, Patel said. Usually, prices increase when the harvest is less.

The MP government had started the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, or price difference payment scheme, in 2017, the farmer said. The government pays farmers the difference between the official minimum support price (MSP) and the rate at which they sell their crops, whichever is higher.

Patel sold his crops under the scheme five years ago but is yet to receive the difference amount. “I am facing yearly losses and wonder whether it is worth farming garlic. But I do not have any choice,” he said.

A farmer in Sehore district’s Kharda village said he would not cultivate garlic and onions anymore. Ashok Parmar said he spent around Rs 45,000 this year on growing onions and garlic on two acres of land.

Parmar spent Rs 7,000 per quintal on garlic seed; however, the rate for the harvest is now Rs 400-500 per quintal. “I have incurred huge losses. There are no guarantees that farmers will receive the MSP either. My family will starve like this,” he said.

Mandsaur, Shajapur, Ujjain and Neemuch districts in the Malwa region of the state produce garlic. A government scheme called one district one product (ODOP) is also run in the state and Mandsaur district has been selected for garlic.

Garlic is also the most important crop in the region. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had issued directives to export garlic and sell it all over the country after a review meeting of the district two months ago.

Chouhan had also instructed that crops from Mandsaur be branded and modern garlic processing work be promoted.

The area producing garlic has more than doubled in the last 10 years. The crop was being grown on 94,945 hectares of land in 2011-12, which increased to 193,066 in 2020-21, according to the Economic Survey of Madhya Pradesh.

The production increased from 1.15 million metric tonnes to 1.98 million metric tonnes in the same period. However, the marketing for the allium crop is still aching even though the production has increased.

Garlic does not come under the minimum support price and there is no provision for it in the central government’s export policy either, said Ravindra Chaudhary of Yuva Kisan Sangathan. “The prices of garlic are up to the open market, so garlic farmers are in a lot of trouble,” said the member of the farmers’ body.

There is no demand for indigenous garlic in India anymore, Chaudhary claims. Garlic from China and Iraq is larger in size and is, therefore, in demand. The allium is being sold for Rs 70 per kg at supermarkets, the farmer activist also pointed out, even as farmers are dumping their crops. Garlic paste retails at Rs 25,000 per quintal, too, he said.

“The government needs to come up with the right policies to safeguard the interests of farmers,” Chaudhary said. Another market intervention scheme by the Centre provides aid to farmers if crop prices go down by 10 per cent or more if there has been a bumper harvest. However, garlic farming does not qualify for it.

“Garlic cloves are smaller this time, which is why the prices are so less,” said Sanjay Mittal, who trades garlic in Mandsaur Mandi. “Around 25-30 per cent of crops were damaged this year. Some crops are selling for Rs 100 per quintal while some can go for Rs 11,000, too,” the trader claimed.

There was a huge demand from Gujarat last year for garlic powder, which is not there this time. Overbuying last year may have led to less demand, said Mittal. “Garlic prices drop drastically every 4-5 years,” he said.

The operations at the Mandsaur Mandi is going smoothly, said Jagdish Singh Parmar, secretary of the market. “The mandi provides its selling arrangements and other facilities. We do not have control over the rate,” he said.",0
797771,"Wheat Crisis: Government procurement goals not met, food security risk increases","Wheat is being purchased at a higher rate than the MSP despite the export ban

The wheat crisis that started earlier this year, is on despite the Centre and states’ efforts, with governments not being able to procure wheat to improve food security. The Centre could procure 18.8 million tonnes (MT) of wheat till June 19, 2022. Punjab had the highest procurement of 9.64 MT, compared to the 13.22 MT that it procured last year. This is the lowest purchase in the past 10 years.

Haryana could only procure 4.2 MT of wheat, compared to 8.5 MT last. Uttar Pradesh recorded the least amount of wheat purchase. It purchased 0.33 MT of wheat this year, compared to 5.6 MT last year.

Madhya Pradesh procured 4.6 MT this year, comparedto 12.8 MT last year. Rajasthan procured just 9,000 tonnes of wheat this year, compared to 2.34 MT last year.

The drastic decline in the government purchase of wheat has been attributed to three main factors. First, traders purchased wheat from farmers at rates higher than the Minimum Support Price (MSP), due to the increase in global wheat prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Second, the intense heat in March and April this year has had an impact on wheat production. And third, the large revenues of the previous year caused a steady shift towards increased mustard cultivation this time, at the cost of wheat.

The UP government took several steps after the state procured low volumes of wheat. But none of them succeeded. The state government also instituted a mobile purchase procedure, informing farmers that officials would visit their villages to buy wheat if they so desired.

However, farmers did not express any interest. The UP government has once again postponed the deadline and will now procure wheat till June 30, 2022.

There is no clear information available about who is buying wheat in Uttar Pradesh. This is because local Arhtiyas (middlemen) contact farmers and offer them prices over the MSP. Moreover, payment is made as soon as the wheat is picked up, whereas a farmer is paid within five to ten days after selling the wheat at a government centre.

Bhartiya Kisan Union (Apolitical) spokesperson Dharmendra Malik said traders started buying wheat from farmers at a higher price after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, the government banned all exports later.

Due to this, traders stopped buying from the farmers and the price fell below the MSP. Following this, traders started buying wheat again at a higher price, which eventually made farmers to stop selling their wheat to the government.

The administration is still unsure of the expected extent of the decline in wheat output. In February 2022, the government had released the second advance estimate, wherein the country’s production estimate was at 111.3 million tonnes.

However, just 5.6 percent of production was predicted to fall short in the advance estimate analysed in May, although experts predicted a production loss of 15-20 per cent. Malik added that the government needed to be open and honest about its production estimates.

On June 10, 2022, a statement came from the Union Ministry of Food and Public Distribution, initially admitted that despite all governmental efforts, the arrival of wheat for government procurement remained low.

However, the statement soon patted the government on the back, stating that wheat farmers across the country had benefited from higher market rates, as most farmers sold their produce to private traders at a higher market rate than the MSP. This, according to the government, is the main goal of its programme for farmers’ welfare.

The ministry stated, “It was discovered that farmers made more money selling their crop in the open market than they did under MSP this season, with an average selling price of Rs 2,150 per quintal.

“In a similar vein, on an anticipated 44.4 MT purchase, farmers would have made an average of roughly Rs 95,460 crore at Rs 2,150 per quintal, whereas the MSP would have made just Rs 89,466 crore at the cost of Rs 2,015 per quintal. Therefore, the wheat farmers would have earned a total of Rs 5,994 crore more than the MSP,” it added.

Food security, however, is at risk since government procurement has not been done. Initially, the government had planned to buy 44.4 MT of wheat during this Rabi season. But with farmers selling their wheat to merchants and the extreme heat in March, wheat production reduced.

As a result, the government changed its plan. The procurement target during the current marketing season was amended to 19.5 MT in the first week of May. Roughly 18.8 MT of wheat have been purchased so far, falling short of this objective as well.",0
798755,Stopping subsidies will be fresh blow for India’s struggling small fishers: Experts,"Fisher community claims already vulnerable fishermen will not be able to access subsidises even if WTO negotiations turn in their favour

Removal of subsidies for fisheries across the world will put small Indian fishers at a greater disadvantage than the present situation, where they are forced into an unfair competition with bigger players within and outside the country, according to experts.

The fear surfaced as negotiations during the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in Geneva hinted at such an outcome.

Fisheries subsidies and the Special and Differential Treatment (S&DT) Act are on the agenda of the conference that will conclude on June 16, 2022.

“The member of WTO wants to do away with the subsidies to make the trade freer for fishers across the planet but all the countries and their fishers are not at the same level,” said Pradip Chatterjee, convener of the National Platform for Small Scale Fisheries (NPSSF).

He added:

The major players, particularly the developed countries, pursuing industrial and commercial fishing have looted the oceans with large capacity equipment and over-fishing. The small fishers have suffered as they cannot compete with such giants.

It is the large-capacity fishers who are extracting marine resources at unprecedented levels, resulting in a faster rate of depletion of fish than replenishing them, said Chatterjee. “The trawlers, purse seines, gill netters and mechanised fishing boats are responsible for the environmental damages and not the small non-mechanised motorboats.”

The small fishers should be protected at all costs from such threats, he said. But representatives of the community claimed the Indian government is doing very little to protect the vulnerable.

“The Indian government in its Indian Fisheries Bill, 2021 has defined small and large fishermen alike. It is portrayed in the bill as if the entire country’s fisher population comprises small fishers. Which does not hold true,” he added.

The representative told Down To Earth:

Such a move will help large fishers in India access subsidies meant for the poor and vulnerable fishers. The large fishers will loot the major chunk of the marine resources, leaving little for the poor, and enjoy the benefits of the subsidies.

NPSSF has written to the Union Ministry of Commerce before MC12 began, urging the Centre to safeguard the interests of the small fishers.

“NPSSFW strongly holds that subsidies provided to the Small Scale Fisheries (SSF) are instrumental to protecting sustainable fishing, large employment, equitable distribution of income, food security and nutritional status of our society,” the organisation said in the letter.

With more than half the workforce being women, the small-scale fisheries sector has also to be supported for gender balance in employment, it added. “As such the provision of subsidies for SSF is non-negotiable.”

“We want the government to protect us from getting the subsidies removed but also, ensure that the interests of small fishers are protected in domestic waters,” Chatterjee added.

The National Fishworkers Forum, which represents nine coastal states and 15 trade unions, organised a Macchimar Sangharsh Yatra (Fishermen struggle march) on June 16 to highlight how the small fishers are getting affected.

“We are already getting displaced from the coastal areas as they are being eroded for port expansion and other development works, forcing us into deep waters,” said Olencio Simoes, general-secretary of the forum.

This is in addition to the hardships due to climate change, which is reducing fish catch and affecting the income, he added. “Moreover, the government is encouraging artificial fishing such as aquaculture and mariculture, which harm the wild capture fishers as they are deprived from the subsidies.”

The yatra started from Kerala and has reached Goa to create awareness among fisherfolk about the cause and encourage participation.

We are also drafting a coastal rights bill to protect the fishing community to table their right to fish, livelihood and land which will soon be submitted to the concerned departments of the government, Simoes said.",0
798785,Chhattisgarh farmers frustrated over black marketing of urea,"Farmers in the state are not getting urea; if they are, it is at almost double the price

Urea prices are skyrocketing in Chhattisgarh due to the government’s decisions these days. So bad is the situation that farmers are being forced to buy urea on the black market and then cultivate paddy at a higher cost and bear the losses. Due to this, farmers from Raipur, Mahasamund, Bilaspur and Gariaband districts have been rendered helpless.

Sushil Bhoi, a farmer from the Bagh Bahra area of Mahasamund district, said: “I went to Saraipali, thinking that a truck was going to bring urea and that I would get at least five to seven sacks. But I was in for disappointment when I reached the spot,” he told this reporter.

Bhoi said he and others complained to government agencies that farmers were having to purchase bags of urea in black at a price of more than Rs 600.

The administration also conducted raids, but nobody was caught due to the nexus between the authorities and others. “It is so bad now that no urea is available even on the black market,” Bhoi said.

Farmer leader Jugnoo Chandrakar said: “When we threatened to disrupt traffic, the Mahasamund collector sought a week’s time and assured that the situation will be back to normal soon.We have also tried to meet the chief minister in this regard. The agriculture minister has also given assurances to us. But there is still no change in the situation.”

Chandrakar said the condition of farmers not registered with cooperative societies was even worse. “In cooperative societies, farmers who are registered, can get a sack of urea for Rs 280-350. The rest have to buy urea from shops, where a sack can cost more than Rs 600,” he said.

Sohan Patel, a farmer from Basna, pointed out that farmers were willing to buy urea at a price slightly higher than rates fixed by cooperative societies, but were not getting urea at all.

Sudesh Tikam, a tribal farmer leader from Rajnandgaon, said the government’s policies and decisions were responsible for the plight of farmers.

“The government had ample opportunities to ensure that the first supply of chemical fertiliser could be made through cooperative societies. But 60 per cent of the urea was distributed to traders and now, traders are doing its black marketing. Who should be held responsible?” he said.

Tikam said the government wants to promote organic farming, but quality vermi-compost is not available in adequate quantity. At present, at least one trolley of vermi-compost will be required for an acre in comparison to two sacks of urea for the same.

More importantly, there is no market for organic farming products in Chhattisgarh, where farmers can get the right price for their produce.

Another important reason behind the black marketing of urea was its linking with Aadhaar cards, Chandrakar said. The linking of Aadhaar cards for availing urea and Diammonium Phosphate has been made mandatory across the country by the Narendra Modi government as the matter is related to subsidy.

But a drawback is that a person can buy as much urea as he wants on an Aadhaar card and the stock of urea is limited. This increases chances of black marketing.",0
798787,What is behind fertiliser shortage in Andhra Pradesh,"The crisis has forced farmers to buy from black market at exorbitent prices

Farmers in Andhra Pradesh, especially in areas which cultivate paddy and maize, complain of shortage of fertiliser, even as the state’s agriculture officials deny it.

Black marketing has made a bad situation worse and the hike in prices of fertilisers has become a double whammy, the farmers said.

A combination of measures brought in by the Centre in the name of transparency has added to the chaos, farm leaders mentioned. The shortage of urea, the most sought-after and subsidised fertiliser, is affecting the input costs of farmers the most.

They say the Rythu Bharosa Kendras (RBK), the state government’s centres at the panchayat level to distribute fertilisers, haven’t made much of a difference as they are also hit by a short supply of fertilisers from the Centre. During the launch of the facility, the state claimed the centres would sell fertilisers at a price Rs 10-25 less than the MRP cited by the companies.

The shortage is forcing them to buy from the black market, said T Bulli Raju, a farmer from Penakanamitta village of Kovuru mandal in East Godavari district. “We are not getting the fertilisers we need and are forced to even compromise on the brand and there by the quality.”

A combination of factors is causing the shortage, according to farm leaders. AP needs 1.6 million tonnes of fertilisers, of which 800,000 tonnes is urea, 300,000 tonnes is diammonium phosphate and the rest are other complex fertilisers.

“Companies making complex fertilisers have been using subsidised fertilisers of other companies as their raw material to make their products,” said S Malla Reddy, vice-president, All India Kisan Sabha. “Thereby, they enjoy double subsidy.”

He added:

Attempts to rein these companies are imperative as they are driven by their profit motive. Diversion of fertilisers meant for AP to other states is another reason for the shortage.

The Centre, while advocating reduced use of chemical fertilisers, has suggested a shift to organic farming for states. “If they want to rein in indiscriminate use of fertilisers in AP and Telangana, they need to test the soil and supply fertilisers accordingly to farmers,” he added.

Spreading organic manure on an acre of farmland costs the farmers Rs 5,000-6,000. Chemical fertilisers are much cheaper, they added. So, the transition cannot happen overnight unless there is an incentive for it.

The Centre, which provided a subsidy of Rs 1,28,761 crore in 2020-21 to Rs 1,40,703 in 2021-22, has reduced its subsidy on fertilisers to Rs 1,05,262 crore for the next financial year.

Attempts to rein in subsidy

Attempts to rein in this subsidy outgo by making Aadhaar-enabled authentication of fertiliser sale to farmers at the retailer level have added to the chaos, according to farmers.

The subsidies are credited to the accounts of the fertiliser companies only after the authentication by the farmers at the point of sale. Problems in connectivity sometimes forces them to sell without authenticating, fertiliser dealers said.

This results in a mismatch between the stock available with them and actual stocks there, making it difficult for retailers in placing further orders. To prevent this, companies send their representatives to dealers, along with those who volunteer, to authenticate these pending transactions.

They also said they are forced to buy products which are not in demand immediately when they seek stocks, and these are pushed on to farmers.

Companies mandated to transport the stock to the retailer within 150 kilometres from the stock point free of cost charge them, the dealers added. The additional money is taken in cash, they shared. This burden of this expense is passed on to the farmers.

The state’s Commissioner of Agriculture H Arun Kumar denied claims of shortage of fertilisers.

“We are forced to buy fertilisers like potash for nearly Rs 1,850 from private fertiliser dealers,” said C Mallikarjun from Tallacheruvu village, Acchampet taluk in Guntur district. “The maximum retail price of urea is Rs 267 and was also sold to us for Rs 420-430 per bag.”

The RBKs could not supply the needed fertilisers in time, he added. “Our capacity to repay money lenders has reduced. We cannot bear it any longer as input costs of pesticides and fertilisers have gone up.”

Finally, dealers aver the authentication system of distribution of fertilisers prevents them from sourcing products in areas with lower demand. This, they said, creates problems in allowing the market dynamics to play a balancing role in fulfilling the needs of farmers in a proactive manner.

Rates of fertilisers increased August-September of 2021.

Name of fertilizer Old rate New rate 20:20:0:13 900 1,390 14:35:14 1,275 1,900 15:15:15 950 1,450 10:26:26 1,080 1,080 Potash 850 1,700 Ammonium Sulphate 700 950",0
798796,Union budget 2022-23: Big cut in fertilisers subsidy to worry farmers,"Urea subsidy cut 17%; allocation for NPK subsidy reduced 35%

Amid acute shortage of fertilisers in India, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman February 1, 2022, reduced subsidy on urea and nutrient-based (NPK) fertilisers. The move is expected to adversely hit the ailing farm sector.

The Rs 63,222.32 crore allocation for urea subsidy in her Budget for 2022-23 was 17 per cent lower than the revised estimates (RE) for 2021-22. Another Rs 42,000 crore was allocated to subsidise NPK fertilisers; that was 35 per cent below the RE.

The Centre has been reducing spending on fertiliser subsidies. The actual government spending on fertilisers in 2020-21 was Rs 127,921.74 crore. It was brought down to Rs 79,529.68 crore in the 2021-22 Union budget. This was revised to Rs 140,122.32 crore amid the farm crisis. In the current budget, it has been brought down by almost 25 per cent to Rs 105,222.32 crore.

The cuts come at a time when record fertilisers prices internationally have affceted regular supply of fertiliser products to Indian farmers. The Narendra Modi government has maintained that there is no shortage in the market, but an analysis of the Integrated Fertilizer Management System (iFMS) data from the Department of Fertilizer, Government of India for October 2021 shows a severe lack of fertiliser products, as per an article by the Economic and Political Weekly.

The country has reported several farmer protests over the shortage. Last October, farmers in Uttar Pradesh’s Mahoba district had to delay sowing due to a fertiliser shortage. Five farmers in Bundelkhand region, which includes 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, also committed suicide due to the shortage. Fertiliser subsidy is a political issue in the upcoming Uttar Pradesh elections.",0
798797,Union Budget 2022-23: No mention of doubling farmers’ income in Sitharaman’s speech,"Omission of references to doubling farmers’ speech surprising given that 2022 is the target year for the scheme

There was no mention of the target of doubling farmer’s income (DFI) in either Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s budget speech February 1, 2022 or the budget documents. The omission is surprising as 2022 is the deadline for that target.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced February 28, 2016 that by the time India celebrated its 75th Independence Day in 2022, its farmers’ income would have doubled.

Last year, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar had said the budget of 2021-22 was aimed at achieving that target. The final budget before the deadline of the target could have been an opportunity for the Centre to outline its work under it and give an overview on the status quo.

Read DTE’s coverage on doubling farmers income

The target seems far away according to recent reports on farmers’ incomes.

The benchmark estimated annual income was Rs 96,703 in 2015-16 which was taken as a base year, according to the government’s DFI report. This comes to be Rs 8,059 per month, which was promised to be doubled in real terms, taking inflation into account by 2022.

“As such, the target income for doubling by 2022 is Rs 21,146 per month (taking inflation also into account),” a statement by Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture or ASHA, said.

However, the estimated monthly income of farm households in 2018-19 was Rs 10,218 per month in nominal terms, as the 77th round of Situation Assessment Survey of Agricultural Households released in 2021 shows. It is nowhere near the target of Rs 21,146 per month.

“The budget was characterised by silence; earlier you had beautiful dialogues about farmers. This was the 6th year of doubling of farmers’ income. The previous five budgets had long poems about this target but now, when it was about accounting for those six years, there was silence,” said Yogendra Yadav of Jai Kisan Andolan.

Another crucial programme that was largely missing in its details was the government’s promotion of the organic farming scheme. Organic farming or natural farming has been listed by the government in the past as one of the activities to achieve DFI target. However, there was nothing much in the budget to that effect.

The only two points highlighted during Sitharaman’s speech in this connection were:

States will be encouraged to revise syllabi of agricultural universities to meet the needs of natural, zero-budget and organic farming, modern day agriculture, value addition and management.

Promotion of chemical-free natural farming throughout the country, with a focus on farmers’ lands in five-kilometre-wide corridors along the Ganga, in the first stage.

But there is no elaboration of this in the budget document. The Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY), which stresses on end-to-end support to organic farmers, has not got any allocation in this year’s budget, according to the budget document.

The only allocation towards organic farming in the budget is of Rs 198 crore towards its development in the North East region.

“The announcements related to organic and natural farming in the budget today are very small steps compared to the need of the hour and specifically after Prime minister’s appeal in December to make natural farming a mass movement,” Amit Khurana, director, Sustainable Food Systems Programme, Centre for Science and Environment, said.

Shweta Saini, who is a Senior Fellow with ICRIER and researches on Indian agricultural policies, said the government has been putting a thrust on zero budget natural farming but that thrust is not visible in the budget.

“Organic farming is diluted in the budget numbers. The document only speaks about its development in the North East region,” she said.",0
798819,"Crop insurance claims over Rs 3,300 crore pending due to payment failure, delay in state subsidy","Farmers belonging Jharkhand, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra have the highest amounts pending under insurance claims

Over Rs 3,300 crore is pending in payment to farmers across India in crop insurance claims since 2018-19 under the government’s flagship crop insurance scheme, due to ‘payment failure’ and delay in state subsidy.

An amount of Rs 3,372.72 crore out of claims worth Rs 66,460 crore in the last three years under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), was pending as on November 25, 2021.

This is according to a reply given by Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar in the Lok Sabha November 30. Of this, Rs 1,087.35 crore was pending for financial year 2020-2021.

Payment failure is one of the most cited reasons across states for non-payment of claims.

All admissible claims are transferred electronically to the bank account of the eligible insured farmers directly or the Aadhar Enabled Payment System.

The reply stated:

However, payment failures occur due to errors in banking details essential for money transfer such as mismatch in name in bank accounts, IFSC Code, account number, dormant bank account and death of eligible insured farmer without nomination, etc, in transfer of claims amount.

The PMFBY was launched in 2016. The government appoints an insurance company, selected through bidding, to insure farmers in a cluster of districts against crop losses due to weather events, pest attacks, or fire as part of the scheme.

The insurer charges the premium on an actuarial rate (an estimate of the expected value of future loss). Farmers under PMFBY pay a fixed two per cent of the sum insured for kharif crops, 1.5 per cent for Rabi and oilseed crops and 5 per cent for commercial / horticultural crops.

The balance is shared by the central and state governments on a 50:50 basis and 90:10 in case of northeastern states.

Farmers belonging Jharkhand, Karnataka, Telangana, and Maharashtra had the highest amounts pending under insurance claims, according to the reply.

The amount of reported claims also saw a huge dip in 2020-21, signalling that the scheme is not finding favour with farmers despite increasing crop damage, especially due to heavy rain.

In 2020-21, the ‘provisional’ amount of reported claims has reduced to Rs 9,725.24 crore, from Rs 27,394 crore in 2019-20.

The admissible claims under the PMFBY are generally paid by the concerned insurance companies within two months of completion of ‘Crop Cutting Experiments’ / harvesting period.

They are paid within one month of notification for invoking the risks / perils of prevented sowing, mid-season adversity and post-harvest losses subject to receipt of total share of premium subsidy from concerned government within time.

“However, settlement of a few claims in some states got delayed due to reasons like delayed transmission of yield data, late release of their share in premium subsidy, yield-related disputes between insurance companies and states, among others,” the government said in another reply to a similar question on crop insurance payment.

‘State subsidy pending’ was the second major reason for non-payment of insurance. The agriculture minister said that some states have not released their share of premium subsidies for certain seasons; however, any specific reasons for such default have not been communicated.

States have not been regular in paying their share of premium over the last few years, citing heavy financial load.

The government, in a separate question on state subsidy in crop insurance payment, stated that the pending state subsidy amounts to Rs 4,744 crore for financial years 2018-2021.

This is more than the amount of the total claims pending. This mismatch in figures was not explained.",0
798833,"Green fodder shortage hits milk production in Bihar, farmers affected","Unable to feed them, farmers resort to distress sale of cattle

Milk production has decreased in Bihar due to shortage of green fodder for milch cattles following excessive rainfall and repeated floods during monsoon this year. This has badly affected cattle farmers.

Sanjay Kumar, deputy director, Bihar Dairy Development Directorate, several farmers had to sell off their milch cattles.

Shortage of green fodders forced hundreds of farmers to sell their cattle in flood-affected Supaul, Katihar, Madhubani, Darbhanga, Vaishali, Begusarai and Samastipur districts.

Mahesh Mandal, a cattle farmer from Darbhanga, said repeated floods damaged the kharif crop too: “We lost green fodder, a staple diet for milch cattles. We cultivated it again after water receded, but it will take a month for it to be ready for harvest.”

He added that with early floods after surplus rainfall in mid-June, farmers used available dry fodder in their storage and green fodder to feed cattle. All was washed or destroyed by floods.

Another cattle farmer, Suraj Yadav of Supaul, said the situation compelled them to resort to distress sale of cattle or purchase high cost dry fodder from the market.

Most fodder and cattle feed went to waste in floods, which have led to the death of 43 people and affected 3 million across 2,104 villages. With cattle already under stress, standing in floodwaters, their yield has gone down. Cows, which used to give 12 litres of milk, now give an average of six litres a day.

Both Mandal and Yadav said increase in dry fodder price also affected them. Till early this year, dry fodder rate cost Rs 500-600 per quintal, which later increased to Rs 900-1,000 a quintal.

Mandal said rising price of diesel also contributed to rise of dry fodder rate: “The government has failed to help cattle farmers of flood-affected districts by not providing dry cattle feed at subsidy rate.”

Milk production decreased 30-40 per cent due to shortage of green fodder in the state, according to officials of the Bihar State Milk Co-Operative Federation Ltd (COMFED).

COMFED’s average daily fresh milk procurement has come down to 8-10 lakh litres from 17-18 lakh litres last year.

Milk production was hit by COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020. Daily milk procurement was nearly 17 lakh litres in 2020; it was more than 18 lakh litres in 2018-19, said COMFED officials.

COMFED is reportedly purchasing milk from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Rajasthan to bridge its demand-supply gap.

Bihar received only three per cent surplus rainfall till September 30 following the arrival of the monsoon on time. This is less than last year’s, when the state received 25 per cent surplus rainfall from June-September.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal from July-August. But Bihar received surplus rainfall in June this year, just as the monsoon arrived. This resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.",0
798898,Incoming corporate wave in food systems will threaten farmers and consumers: Report,"This will trigger massive shift of rural dwellers to urban areas, exacerbate land and resource grabs by corporations

An incoming ‘corporate tidal wave’ in the food industry as well as farming may threaten the interests of millions of farmers and consumers alike, a recent report has cautioned. This may trigger a massive shift of rural dwellers to urban areas, exacerbate land and resource grabs by corporations and make supply chains more susceptible to pandemics and climate change.

The report, released March 30, 2021, analysed ‘business-as-usual’ food systems and how it may evolve over the next quarter century (by 2045) as corporations and governments respond to environmental breakdown, social dislocation, geopolitical reconfiguration and a vast pipeline of technological possibilities.

The scenario will mean handing the keys of the food system over to big data, technology and e-commerce platforms, which may exacerbate food insecurity and further environmental degradation, the report said.

The report was released by International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES) and ETC group (Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration).

The study warned of specific threats to farming and food security if agribusiness plans come to fruition:

Artificial intelligence is re-engineering ecosystems, and robotic tractors and drones are being rolled out as fast as digital infrastructures allow. Millions of rural dwellers will be forced to migrate to urban areas.

Data on food is a valuable strategic asset. Peasants, whose land acquires a new value now that it is more readily accessible to robotic farm equipment, are vulnerable to fresh land grabs. The report cautioned that a new wave of land, ocean and resource grabs is imminent.

Powerful corporations and major governments are now moving to control food supplies across vast economic corridors. Long, complex global supply chains will be more vulnerable to pandemics, climate change and critical ‘chokepoints’.

‘Hyper-nudging’ is on the rise. This means data from everyday transactions (digital wallets to automated food services) is getting increasingly combined with information harvested online to manipulate people’s eating habits.

“The keys of the food system are being handed over to data platforms, private equity firms, and e-commerce giants. This is the dystopian future of food and the planet, unless civil society fights back,” warned Pat Mooney, lead author of the study.

The authors stressed on the ‘Long Food Movement’ for the next 25 years — a series of strategies that could boost post-COVID-19 pandemic resilience, slash agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions by 75 per cent, and shift $4 trillion from the industrial food chain to food sovereignty and agroecology.

The report added: “This includes $720 billion in subsidies going to big commodity production, and as much as $1.6 trillion in healthcare savings from a crackdown on junk food. The sum total of these actions could cut 75 per cent of food system emissions.”

Some of the key strategies include:

Diverting funds from major commodity subsidies, research expenditures and ‘niche’ budget lines to small-scale food producers.

Supporting short supply chains and territorial markets: By 2045, as much as 50 per cent of food would be sourced from local and regional supply chains. Up to 80 per cent of wealthier populations can go flexitarian.

Levying taxes on junk food, toxins, carbon dioxide emissions and the revenues of multinationals.

Adopting emergency food security measures that supersede trade and intellectual property rules.

Ensuring that famine, malnutrition and environmental degradation are considered criminal violations that can be internationally prosecuted.

796701,Pressure from banks pushes farmers to commit suicide',"One year since the Maharashtra farmer protests, Down To Earth speaks to Raghunath Dada Patil on the deepening crisis

Raghunath Dada Patil, a Maharashtra-based farmer leader and national president of ‘Shetkari Sanghthan’, talks to Down To Earth on the one-year anniversary of Maharashtra farmer protests long march from Nasik to Mumbai. Former member of the NITI Ayog expert committee on agriculture, he speaks on the under-value farm loans and the recent cases against farmers in Punjab for defaulting on loans

Maharashtra has witnessed a series of farmers protests. In February 2018, the protests caught the attention of the national media when around 50,000 farmers walked from Nashik to Mumbai. Do you think indebtedness of farmers in Maharashtra is going to be an issue in the upcoming parliamentary election? Also, do you think the recent farm loan waivers in Maharashtra helped indebted farmers?

Farmer protests in Maharashtra are highest among all Indian states. It’s the government policies which push the farmers into a debt trap and consequently to commit suicide. The number of farmer suicides have increased during the Narendra Modi government.

The loan waiving scheme turned out to be another phase of harassment for farmers as it did not help them. As per the scheme, one needs to pay back the debt already undertaken minus Rs 1.5 lakh. If a farmer has of debt Rs 5 lakh, as per government scheme, one farmer needs to pay back debt of Rs 3.5 lakh to the bank to settle complete debt.

After three years of BJP rule in Maharashtra, the state government came out with a loan waiving scheme of Rs 1.5 lakh per farmer. This scheme was like a one-time settlement of debt to avail waiver of Rs 1.5 lakh.

If I had Rs 3 lakh why would I be living like this? We don’t have that amount of money, so we don’t get the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver. Another problem is that those who have got their loan waived once won’t get the waiver for the second time.

We asked for loan waivers as we didn’t get the right price for our produce. Now, they have declared it in their election manifesto that if they get elected again, they will give 50 per cent profit on cost of production.

Narendra Modi started his tenure as Prime Minister with this issue, yet the issue is not solved. If he had solved this issue, it would not be an issue in this election again.

The other declaration of providing Rs 2,000 income support to farmers won’t help them either. In a five-member family, what will a person do with just Rs 2,000? I spend Rs 2,000 on just a tractor… It won’t give us any relief.

With the animal slaughter ban, animal rearing became difficult; we can’t even sell the animal later.

There should be a permanent solution, there’s no proper water and electricity supply still people are ready to do handwork. But we still don’t get the real price for our produce.

Till the 1960s, when I was a kid, the population was 40 crores, and agricultural produce was imported from from Australia, Canada, USA, Russia etc. Wheat and rice were the main produce. Back then, we did not have the capacity to feed the population, so we imported from outside.

Today the population is 130 crores, but we produce enough to feed the entire population. There is no scarcity of food, rather the production is so high that there is no place to preserve the surplus.

Who produces this? Tata or Birla? No. Farmers are producing that amount of food, we made the country self-sufficient, but all we got was poison. The government is doing all this because they want us to leave our villages, become cheap labour for the corporate sector, cheap domestic helps for their homes.

Tenant farmers are always at the receiving end. They do not get any benefit of any scheme like loan waivers or income support. How do you think the problems of sharecroppers or tenant farmers can be solved?

It doesn’t matter, whether it is the tenant farmer or sharecroppers or labourers. They must pay rents, which is usually fixed. Don’t divide farmers on that basis and just give them their profit, they can manage it afterwards. Abolish the export ban, if they accepted a free economy, then why put a minimum export price on onion.

A long-term policy of transparency is needed. In sugar industry, C. Rangarajan-led committee suggested an end to the export ban, yet it is not implemented even after 10 years.

You have said there is huge disparity in loan sanctioned and real value of agricultural land. The loan sanctioned to a farmer is much less than value of land. How do you see this disparity?

A stark difference is there, we don’t get even one per cent of the land price. If the cost is Rs 1 lakh, we get only Rs 1,000. Now, it has been increased to Rs 10-15 lakh for one acre; in Punjab it is Rs 20-25 lakh for an acre. But, they provide a maximum of Rs 2-4 lakh on crops, if there is any water project or tractor, they give us Rs 5-10 lakh. When the land cost is up to Rs 1 crore, they give us Rs 10 lakh.

They don’t give us the real price. We have a demand that they give us 80 per cent loan on e-stamp duty and Ready Reckoner (a guide published annually by state governments, which determine the rate of properties in a particular area, on which stamp duty and registration charges are levied).

Just like they give 80 per cent loan on gold, they should give us 80 per cent loan on Ready Reckoner rates. But we don’t get that.

Q: In above context, don’t you think farmers may end up losing their land or are you indirectly saying that farmers should give up farming after taking value of land?

To collect stamp duty, they set the price of our land at Rs 5 lakh per acre based on cropping in 1 acre. If they us 80 per cent loan on the value of land, no one will have to commit suicide.

The current financial plans are not enough for farmers. If you give me Rs 2 lakh to build a well, but the actual price for constructing it is Rs 3 lakh, then the Rs 2 lakh didn’t really help.

Why will a farmer leave his land? Land price increase with time so he/she will not leave. Now with the system of Gunthewari (measuring land by Guntha as a unit), 40 Gunthe is equal to 1 acre; but it is banned to purchase land below 10 Gunthe. Now if I want to sell 2 Gunthe of land for some reason — marriage, medical emergency —I can’t sell that.

Q: How can farmers handle the pressure from banks in case of default?

See, because of this pressure, farmers commit suicide. There are three reports on this — first by Sharad Joshi which said that there is no subsidy for farmers in this country but only negative subsidy.

Second report by the Tata Institute for Social Science has clearly stated that Krishi Lagat Aivam Mulya Aayog (1955) is responsible for farmer suicides. The price they give is too less. The third report, or the MS Swaminathan report, states that to stop farmer suicides they should be given 50 per cent of the production cost.

Despite these reports, the government has not adopted these recommendations. The export ban should end if onion price rises above Rs 30, otherwise they should put export ban on every crop so we can get a good market value.

The Essential Commodity Act (1955) should be abolished. An industrialist gets subsidy whenever he exports his production. That is the export incentive. But they ban the same in the case of farmers.

Q: What is the way out for farmers from this land crisis? What kind of protective or preventive measures should be taken?

Nothing more needed from the government if they can abolish the Acts that prevail since the British era. If we get good price for our production, we will pay our debts, nothing else is needed.

Q: Reports by Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) show farmers never get the minimum support price (MSP) for their produce. Don’t you think there should be a mechanism like to provide assured income like in the case of Telangana and Odisha?

Nobody gets the MSP that’s why farmers commit suicide. Yes, Rs 12,000 won’t help us. These schemes are only for two years, after that they won’t give us anything. Until we get the cost of production, these small things won’t help us. When farmers are given money, prices of other things go up, like petrol, diesel and seeds. The money flows out easily.

796726,"‘Govt is cheating us, destroying traditional agriculture’","Farmers living in tribal areas in Jharkhand alleged that industrialists and the government are conspiring to ruin diverse traditional seeds and crops

Farmers from Jharkhand’s Singhbhum district, a tribal area, alleged that the government and industrialists are trying to destroy their traditional knowledge of agriculture and looting cultivable land.

This happened on the last day of a conference held on ‘Traditional agriculture: challenges and possibilities’ at Chaibasa this month. These farmers belonged to Gangaram Kalundia Forum, named after a leader who was murdered in 1982 while fighting for the villagers’ fundamental rights against displacement.

“Much-acclaimed increase in agricultural production during green revolution was the result of proper irrigation facilities and an increase in agricultural land. On the other hand, dams built in the name of irrigation have actually been built for the benefit of the corporate houses,” read a declaration released by the farmers.

They further alleged that the Centre’s and the state government’s “propaganda” about farmers adopting advanced seeds by introducing high-yielding and hybrid seeds is to destroy their “rich treasure of diverse traditional seeds and crops”.

According to the declaration, “Millions of seeds, which were the basis of our food sovereignty and biodiversity, are lost forever. By stripping farmers of lands in the name of alleged development and depriving us of our food sovereignty and corresponding nutritional security, our constitutionally protected right to life is under attack.”

The farmers have demanded that gram sabhas be allowed to develop and promote traditional agriculture, knowledge on integrated farming be spread, traditional seeds be conserved, traditional farming practices be given preferences and village societies be given control over forests under the Forest Rights Act 2006.

They also want the government to reject amendments to Jharkhand's tenancy laws like Chhotanagpur Tenancy Act and the Santhal Pargana Tenancy Act, and to the Land Acquisition Act, 2013 to ensure no acquisition of cultivable land.",0
796992,"Stubble Burning: Central Govt. Refuses to Give Cash Incentive to Farmers, Says Bhagwant Mann","Bhagwant Mann said that the government is arranging equipment on a large scale for the remaining 38 lakh acres and that this season, more than one lakh crop residue management machines will be made available for controlling stubble.

On Saturday, Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann told media that the Central government has reportedly turned down the Punjab government's proposal of contributing to the cash incentive to farmers for not burning stubble.

This development follows the Punjab government's proposal to pay paddy farmers Rs.2,500 per acre. According to a report from PTI, the government had proposed that the Centre pay 1,500 per acre while Punjab and Delhi governments would be responsible for paying Rs.1,000 per acre.

It is important to note that the paddy straw burning in Punjab and Haryana is one of the reasons behind the alarming spike in air pollution levels in the national capital in October and November as farmers set their fields on fire to quickly clear off the crop residue before cultivating wheat and potato. Additionally, Punjab also produces over 20 million tonnes of paddy straw each year.

In a video message on Saturday, the chief minister of Punjab stated, ""We had written to the Centre that it should help us with the issue of stubble burning. But the Centre rejected our demand.""

However, the chief minister of Punjab said it does not matter. If the central government is not supporting then it does not mean we will not do anything.

Bhagwant Mann also informed that he has asked his officers to come up with a different solution to address the issue. Mann shared some information about stubble burning and noted that 75 lakh acres of paddy are sown. He further said that farmers manage stubble across a 37 lakh acre area using machinery for crop residue management or other methods.

Mann said that the government is arranging equipment on a large scale for the remaining 38 lakh acres and that this season, more than one lakh crop residue management machines will be made available for controlling stubble.

It must be noted that the Centre gives funds for the provision of subsidized machines for the management of crop residue, as per the report, under the in-situ management (mixing crop residue in soil) of the paddy stubble scheme.",0
797033,PM Kisan Latest Update: 1 Lakh Farmers May Not Get 12th Installment,"All PM Kisan farmers must check beneficiary status as well as list to confirm if they will get the next installment of Rs. 2000 or not.

If you are a beneficiary of PM Kisan scheme and waiting for the next installment then we have an important update for you. Officials of the agriculture department said that as many as 1 lakh farmers may be deprived of financial assistance this time.

The agriculture department of Andhra Pradesh informed that around 1 lakh beneficiaries in Prakasam district may not get Rs. 2000 under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana this time as they have not completed their eKYC. It is important to mention that the government had made eKYC compulsory for all the farmers.

Further, the agriculture department said that there are almost 3.18 lakh farmers in Prakasam district. Though all of them have completed their Aadhaar authentication process or the registration process for PM Kisan, only 2.2 lakh have finished the eKYC process as well.

Officials told the Centre has extended the deadline to complete the eKYC process four times still only 68% of the farmers have completed it till September 15.

Previously, the Centre had declared 31 July as the deadline, but after request from the State government as well as farmers’ associations, the last date to complete eKYC was extended three times & finalised to 18 September.

Agriculture Joint Director (JD-A), A Srinivasa Rao said now we have no information if the deadline for completing eKYC will be further extended.

Also, there are reports that out of the abovementioned 1 lakh farmers in the district who will not receive financial aid, around 35,000 could be ineligible as they might be paying Income Tax or have more than 1 beneficiary in the family, or have submitted the wrong documents. The remaining 65,000 are eligible, but their details are not known.

Reports further said that these farmers have not been living at their registered residential addresses and their mobile phone numbers are also not reachable.

796711,"Rains fall short: Major losses ahead, fear Bengal paddy farmers","Heavy rain for rest of monsoon might complete the deficit, says IMD, but will that be enough?

Kharif crops in West Bengal have been severely affected due to insufficient rain this monsoon season. Farmers in the state, especially in south Bengal, heavy losses as Aman paddy cultivation has been hit by rainfall deficit.

West Bengal has a deficit of 39 per cent, while south Bengal has a deficit of 47 per cent.

“Farmers have not been able to even sow the seeds due to the lack of rain,” said Anil Gope, a paddy farmer from Burdwan district.

Gope has 10 bighas of agricultural land. “There is no irrigation system here, so farming is completely dependent on rainwater,” he said. “If the rainfall becomes normal by August 15, I still have a chance to harvest crops. Else I will face huge losses.” A bigha of land is around 0.62 acres.

The farmer invests around Rs 60,000 on his farm every year. He will lose earnings for the entire year if there is no rain, as post-monsoon potato and mustard crops would also be affected.

Monsoon had a late start in the region this year, around June 18, which is a delay of 10 days, said GK Das, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Kolkata. This year, the monsoon is estimated to officially withdraw from Bengal on October 10.

“The overall deficiency is primarily caused by two reasons: Late onset of monsoon and no low-pressure area near Bangladesh or Bay of Bengal to bring more rain to West Bengal,” he said.

Low pressures in these areas lead to heavy to mid-level rain in south Bengal. A low-pressure area was created near the Andhra coast; therefore, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had enough rain in July, for example.

Monsoon 2022 is expected to be normal for Bengal, Das said. “However, two to three good depressions or low-pressure systems are needed for a normal monsoon,” he said.

There may be some heavy or continuous rains in the remaining days of July and all of August, September and the beginning of October, the weatherman added.

“As we are facing extreme weather events due to climate change. Continuous or heavy rainfall can help recover from the deficiency,” Das said

Major paddy-growing districts like Howrah, Hoogly, Nadia and Burdwan are already lagging in sowing this season compared to previous years.

“So far, I have not invested in Aman harvesting at all,” said Tosalia Dhabek from Nadia district’s Hanshkhali.

Dhabek has 10 bighas of agricultural land, and he usually harvests paddy on around half of it, investing around Rs 25,000.

“There is no rain and irrigation systems aren’t working as well in the absence of enough rain. Even if it rains at August-end, paddy farming is possible,” the farmer said.

“Then it will be mustard in September-October and again paddy in February,” Dhabek said. No Aman harvest will mean a huge setback for him.

Farmer Kartik Mandal from Hoogly district’s Khanakul has sown paddy seeds on three bighas of land, hoping for better rain. He has two acres where he also plants potatoes and almonds.

“I have to spend Rs 105 per litre of kerosene to run a water pump for my farm. On sowing days, the pump runs for four hours a day. This is impossible for small-scale farmers,” he said. Good rain for the rest of the monsoon will give him a chance to recover his money.

Mandal is a member of a cooperative society which gives him a loan of Rs 30,000 for Aman harvesting. He has sown 15 kilograms of paddy seeds, priced at Rs 105 per kg.

The farmer had already faced losses in his almond harvest earlier this year due to continuous rain at the end of April. Last year, he sold Rs 2,47,000 worth of almonds but didn’t even get a lakh rupees this time.

Another farmer complained that seeds are drying up due to lack of rain. “I have already sowed 22 kgs of paddy seeds on my six bighas. It will all be ruined if there is no rain. How will I survive,” asked Manotosh Dolui from Howrah district’s Amta.

Dolui has sown seeds priced 60 per kg in his low-lying land and seeds priced 72 per kg on the high ground. He usually invests Rs 40,000-50,000 for a return of around Rs 60,000-70,000, barely enough to sustain his family.

“Even irrigation systems need some good rain,” he said.

Like Mandal, Dolui also faced losses in his mustard and almond nuts.

However, he lost his crops to a lack of rain after March. “I only got 8-10 kgs of harvest per katha of land, instead of the usual 30-32 kgs,” he said. A katha is equal to 0.0165 acres of land.

796742,"Deficient rainfall in Bihar, paddy farmers fear drought, crop loss","Most of Bihar’s 38 districts are facing rainfall deficit, according to IMD’s data

Paddy farmers in Bihar fear a drought and loss of their crops after the state recorded a large deficit in rainfall in the crucial first half of July.

Some 80-85 per cent of paddy farmers in Bihar have prepared seedlings (known locally as dhan bichra), according to Bihar’s agriculture secretary N Sarvana Kumar. Most farmers have prepared paddy seedlings on their small patches farmland.

But the transplantation of paddy seedlings has been done in only 0.67 million hectares (mha) of the total target of 3.52 mha. “If rainfall had been normal, nearly 40 per cent of paddy seedlings should have been transplanted so far,” an official told this reporter.

The transplantation of paddy seedlings is as low as five per cent in 15 districts and 10 per cent in 17 districts, according to the department. The transplantation of paddy seedlings was completed on 1.36 mha of 3.3 mha till July 16. In 2020, it was done on 1.76 mha of 3.3 mha.

Sanjay Kumar, an official at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Centre, Patna, said July 15, 2022, that Bihar recorded 194.6 millimetres (mm) of rainfall from June 1 to July 15.

This was 42 per cent less than the normal 335.6 mm of rainfall. The state has received only 22.4 mm rainfall from July 1-15, which is 87 per cent less than the normal 172.4 mm.

Most of Bihar’s 38 districts are facing rainfall deficit, according to IMD’s data. The deficit in Araria, Purnea, Madhepura, Bhagalpur, Buxar and Supaul is nearly 97 per cent to 95 per cent.

The deficit in other districts is 90 to above 60 per cent, except Kaimur, where deficient rainfall is 32 per cent, the lowest in the state.

Hundreds of thousands of farmers across Bihar are facing a difficult situation due to the rainfall deficit.

Praying for rain

Pramod Singh and Lakhan Prasad, both marginal farmers of Karpi block in Arwal district, fear a drought as there has virtually been no rain in the last 15 days in July.

“Our farmland and paddy seedlings are ready for transplantation. But we are yet to start transplantation due to lack of water and rainfall deficit,” Singh, a resident of Katesar village, said.

“We farmers are waiting for rain even during the month of Sawan (Shravana) to start the much-awaited paddy seedlings transplantation. If the long dry spell continues for one more week, a drought is certain,” Prasad, a resident of Kinjar village, said.

Even big and well-off landowners, who managed to complete paddy transplantation by using diesel pump sets and electric-run motors, are worried about the rainfall situation.

“We have used a diesel pump set to avail water and complete paddy seedlings transplantation. But we are not sure how long they will survive without rain,” Shivnath Pandey, a farmer of Kutumba block in Aurangabad district, said.

It is not easy to pull out ground water daily as water evaporates from farmland due to the hot and humid climate, Pandey added.

“There is no water in the canal because the water resources department has failed to discharge water for irrigation purposes despite no rainfall,” Dhananjay Kumar, a farmer of Bala Bigha under Haspura block in Aurangabad, said.

Aurangabad has recorded a deficit of 85 per cent. So far, nearly one per cent of paddy seedling transplantation has been completed in the district.

Aurangabad district agriculture officer Ranveer Kr Singh said he had appealed to all farmers to save their paddy seedlings and keep them alive for transplantation as rainfall was expected next week.

Khagaria district agriculture officer Shailesh Kumar said paddy seedlings transplantation was badly hit by poor monsoon.

Dinkar Prasad, Katihar district agriculture officer, said nearly 32 per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted so far. The transplantation process was getting delayed due to deficient rainfall, he added.

Nearly 25 per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted till date in Supaul, Kirshi Vigyan Kendra’s scientist Manoj Kumar, said.

In several districts including Jamui, Nawada and Banka, farmers have been struggling to keep their paddy seedlings green as they turn yellow due to lack of water.

“My farmland is dry. Even the nursery of paddy seedlings has developed cracks because of no rain since the last two weeks. Am doing everything to save them. But this is a challenge as temperatures are hovering at 35-37°C,” Musafir Mahto, a marginal farmer of Sinhauli village in Nawada, said.

Mahto said hardly one per cent of paddy seedlings had been transplanted in his area.

N Sarvana Kumar said this past week that so far, only 15-20 per cent of the transplantation of paddy seedlings had been completed. The agriculture department has targeted 3.52 million hectares for paddy cultivation this year.

The state’s agriculture minister Amrendra Pratap Singh said the government was aware of the situation and asked district officers to provide help to farmers by ensuring supply of power and other measures.

Bihar’s farmers are heavily dependent on monsoon rain for kharif crops, mainly paddy, a water-intensive crop.

In the last 13 years, monsoon rainfall has been above normal five times in June. In 2021, Bihar received 111 per cent surplus rainfall, 82 per cent in 2020, 37 per cent in 2011, 5 per cent in 2013 and 6 per cent in 2022.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal during July and August. But surplus rainfall in June resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.",0
798745,Dry to deluge: Incessant rain a threat to Marathwada farmers,"After scanty rainfall in June & early July, Maharashtra region now has a problem of too much downpour in too short a span

Large parts of Marathwada and Vidarbha have been severely affected by the incessant rain

Incessant rain in Marathwada, which was going dry not so long ago, has turned a threat to farmers.

Rain in the last 15 days has damaged about 100,000 acres of agricultural land in Maharashtra, according to officials. Vidarbha region has also reported major losses.

The state received over 35 per cent more rainfall in July, recording 459 mm against the expected rain of 340 mm. Several districts reported rainfall 200 per cent above average.

The weather conditions are likely to persist through July 16.

A farmer from Kurunda village in Marathwada said the erratic rains had destroyed 15 acres of crops. “I lost my soybean and turmeric plots overnight due to the unceasing rains on July 12,” lamented Ashok Dalvi.

Dalvi had been eagerly waiting for the monsoons for respite but has now lost all hopes of a successful harvest. He had spent Rs 70,000 on sowing and fertilisers. “The excessive rains have washed my investment down the drain,” he told Down to Earth.

Farmers said their crops had been destroyed by the deluge

About 55 per cent of Marathwada region and around 40 per cent of Vidarbha has been severely affected by the rain, said Dheeraj Kumar, state agriculture commissioner. Around 100,000 acres of agricultural land has been destroyed, he said.

Kumar said Aurangabad district has received 206 per cent more rainfall in July already, with 132 mm rainfall against the 68 mm average.

The official record from the divisional commissioners showed that rain in Hingoli district deviated by 303 per cent, recording 353 mm rain against an expected 116.

Kalamnuri taluka saw 431 per cent excess rain, while Basmat saw 274 per cent more rainfall. Aundha and Sengaon talukas also received 285.5 per cent and 268.2 per cent excess rain, respectively.

The scenarios in other districts were similar. Drought-affected Latur received 66.8 mm of rain in 24 hours, Osmanabad had 42.5 mm.

Nanded district received an average of 123mm rainfall over a 24-hour period, officials had reported on July 13.

The head of the Kurunda village, Rajesh Patil, said that 20,000 farmers in Hingoli district are facing a fate similar to Dalvi.

“The entire village is affected because of the incessant rains,” said Patil. “The agricultural land is submerged, plots and cattle have been washed away and there is no guarantee that resowing will lead to a harvest.”

The rain over the last fortnight has affected 70 per cent of agriculture production in Marathwada, said Jayajirao Suryawanshi, a farmer activist.

“Incessant rainfall in various pockets has damaged crops like tur dal and cotton. Meanwhile, several parts of the region have not received rain. These farmers are also staring at heavy losses,” he said.

Suryawanshi claimed that several suicides by farmers had also been reported.

Official figures from the divisional commissionerate showed that as many as 306 cases of farmer suicides had been confirmed in Aurangabad for June.

The erratic rains have made farming a hazardous profession, Suryawanshi told DTE.

“Marathwada did not receive much rain in June and early July. But the rain intensity increased in the last few days and covered the deficit. But rains like these can lead to crop damage instead of being beneficial,” he said.

He said that farmers would be in an even trickier situation if rains pause entirely for the next 15 days of the month.

Areas that received more than 90mm of rainfall within 24 hours can be categorised as having received excessive rainfall, said Uday Deolankar, former agriculture advisor with the state government.

“However, the areas that have received it traditionally receive more rain,” Deolankar added.

The cause of excess rain

An increase in the severity of east-moving easterly winds and west-moving winds, or westerlies, have caused high-pressure conditions in central Maharashtra, causing rains, Deolankar said.

But the expert pointed out that rains recorded in low-intensity regions have also resulted in flooding or water stagnation.

This is because the concentration time has been reduced. “The time of concentration is the period required for rains to drop in the catchment area and flow downstream,” he said.

There are fewer hurdles due to rapid urbanisation and surface run-off allows water to flow faster, leading to flooding.

He added that delays in monsoons have already pushed the sowing season and the incessant rains may lead to losses.

“The rainy conditions are likely to improve after July 14. The rainfall and the weather conditions in the next two days will help us understand the gravity of losses,” Deolankar said.

Kumar said the data had been shared with the officials concerned, who will estimate the losses and issue guidelines for compensation to farmers.",0
798838,Heavy rains damage paddy crop in Bihar’s Seemanchal and Kosi regions,"Standing crops have been damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year

Unexpected heavy rainfall in October has ended the hopes of paddy farmers in northeastern Bihar’s Seemanchal and Kosi regions of getting a good crop this year.

Vinod Kumar, a scientist at the Araria Krishi Vigyan Kendra, told this reporter that heavy rains October 18 and 19, 2021 had damaged harvested paddy and also affected standing paddy.

“No one expected this. The rains have not only damaged paddy but will also delay cultivation of rabi crops such as potato due to waterlogging and moisture in fields,” Kumar said.

Satyendra Jha and Ravindar Yadav, who are marginal farmers of Araria district, were happy till last week as they expected a good paddy harvest either by the end of October or early next month.

But their hopes have been dashed after the heavy rains of the last 48 hours.

“Several farmers had harvested paddy and left it to dry in their fields. They would be hit hard. The rains have also damaged flowering paddy,” Yadav, a resident of a village under the Sikti block, said.

“The standing paddy is now submerged under rainwater and is unlikely to germinate as rains continue October 20. This will affect paddy output per hectare and quality as well,” Jha, a resident of a village near Forbesganj, said.

Pravin Kr Jha, Kishanganj district agriculture officer, said he has directed all block-level agriculture officials to survey and assess damage caused to paddy by heavy rains and submit a report soon.

“The magnitude of the damage will be known only after block agriculture officials submit their reports,” he added.

The state agriculture department had released the state’s official paddy production target of 118 lakh metric tonnes (MT) in August this year. The target last year was 90 lakh MT last year.

This year, paddy has been transplanted in nearly 72 per cent of the total 33 lakh hectares identified for production, as compared to 29.22 lakh hectares last year.

But last week, Sanjay Kumar, additional chief secretary in the state Cabinet, said repeated floods and surplus rains had damaged standing crops across thousands of hectares as farmland.

Read Bihar to give subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate crops due to waterlogging

Standing crops were damaged in about 663,776.28 hectares due to floods, excessive rains and waterlogging this year, according to the agriculture department’s assessment.

Farmers could not even sow in about 141,227 hectares this kharif season as large tracts of agricultural land remained under water due to excessive monsoon rainfall.

The state government for the first time earmarked Rs 100 crore in farm subsidy to farmers who could not cultivate on their land due to waterlogging.

Strange monsoon

This year, Bihar has received only three per cent surplus rainfall after the arrival of the monsoon on time. This is less than last year when the state received 25 per cent surplus rainfall from June to September.

Heavy rainfall in the state is normal during July and August. But Bihar received surplus rainfall in June this year, just as the monsoon arrived. This resulted in floods in the low-lying areas.

Sanjay Kumar, weather scientist at the India Meteorological Department, Patna, said Bihar recorded surplus rainfall in June 2020 and 2021.

“This is the maximum rainfall the state has received in the last decade in June,” he said.

According to him, Bihar received 97.8 millimetres (mm) of rain in June 2019, nearly 40 per cent less than normal; 100.3 mm in 2018; 84.6 mm in 2017; 128.7 mm in 2016 and 123.6 mm in 2015.

After the monsoon had retreated from the region, Bihar has received 140.3 mm rainfall October 18-19, 2021, according to the India Meteorological Department. This was 157 per cent more the 54.7 mm the state usually receives at this time.

The rainfall was especially heavy in the Seemanchal and Kosi regions of the state.

Araria received 95 mm rainfall between October 18 and 19. Other places that received heavy showers included Kishanganj (67.45 mm), Katihar (66 mm), Khagaria (74.9 mm), Saharsa (74 mm), Supaul (50 mm) and Madhepura (45 mm).

The local meteorological office has forecast more rainfall in the coming two to three days.

Heavy rain in Bihar during October was unusual, according to weather experts. They did not rule out climate change as the cause.",0
